<h2>Web Containers / Web Frameworks</h2>
<p>There are only about a million Java web-frameworks for Java. There
more recent and sophisticated ones try to do Dependency Injection for
'actions' or 'controllers'. </p>
<p>If you want to use PicoContainer for a web framework, then you're
likely to end up with three container levels. The root container would
be common to all and known as the <strong>application scoped</strong> container. Next is a <strong>session-scoped</strong> one, with the app one marked as its parent. Lastly a <strong>request scoped</strong>
one, with the session one marked as its parent. There are two
not-so-subtle varations on how they would be used. One, we poineered
with PicoContainer 1.x in 2003, the other inroduced with PicoContainer
2.x in 2007.</p>
<h3>PicoContainer and web frameworks - the old way.</h3>
<p>You make one instance of the app container. For each new HTTP
Session you make a new session level container, and put it into the
session itself - refer HttpSession.setAttribute(key,val). For each
request, you make a new Request level container and discard it at the
end of the request. For as long as it lives, the request level
container's parent would be the session container.</p>
<p>There are two downsides of this approach. 1) you have to repeatedly
add components to the session and request containers as they are
instantiated. 2) the serialization of the session (by Tomcat etc) might
cause more things to be serialized than you intend - i.e. the session
container refers to the application container.</p>
<h3>PicoContainer and web frameworks - the new way.</h3>
<p>You make one instance of the app, session and request container on
servlet load. For the Application one, you choose Caching as the
behavior factory. For the session and request level ones, you choose
Storing instead. You wrap the Storing behavior factory instances in
HttpSessionStoring and reprogram each http request like so:</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>public class MyTinyPicoServlet extends HttpServlet {

    private DefaultPicoContainer requestContainer;

    private HttpSessionStoring sessionStoring;
    private HttpSessionStoring requestStoring;

    public void init(ServletConfig cfg) throws ServletException {

        PicoContainer appContainer = new DefaultPicoContainer(new Caching()); // app scoped components are cached for all users/sessions

        Storing storingBehavior1 = new Storing();
        PicoContainer sessionContainer = new DefaultPicoContainer(storingBehavior1, appContainer);
        sessionStoringAdapter = new HttpSessionStoringAdapter(storingBehavior1, "sessionStore");

        Storing storingBehavior2 = new Storing();
        requestContainer = new DefaultPicoContainer(storingBehavior2, sessionContainer);
        requestStoringAdapter = new HttpSessionStoringAdapter(storingBehavior2, "requestStore");

        // populate app, session and request scoped containers.
        appContainer.addComponent(HibernateManager.class, MyHibernateManager.class); // all sessions share one HibernateManager
        sessionContainer.addComponent(ShoppingCart.class, FifoCart.class); // a new cart per user
        requestContainer.addComponent("/addToCart.do", AddToCart.class); // key crudely maps to URL
        requestContainer.addComponent("/removeFromCart.do", RemoveFromCart.class);
        // etc

    }

    protected void service(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
        throws ServletException, IOException {

        sessionStoringAdapter.retrieveOrCreateStore(req.getSession()); // associate thread with session, for caching (session scoped components)
        requestStoringAdapter.resetStore(); // cache components per request (request scoped components)

        Action action = (Action) requestContainer.getComponent(req.getPathTranslated());

        try {
            action.execute(req, resp); // yeah yeah, this is pretty basic
        } finally {
            sessionStoringAdapter.invalidateStore();
            requestStoringAdapter.invalidateStore();
        }
        // trying to retrieve components from at session or request scopes from here on will result in an UnsupportedOperationException
    }

}
</pre>
</div>
<p>The HttpSessionStoring class is not in the core jar, its in the
'gems' one. If you don't want a second jar - copy the class (it's real
simple) to your web framework's codebase.</p>
