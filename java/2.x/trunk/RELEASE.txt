RELEASE STEPS

1. mvn release:prepare -> verifies dependendies and tags release in SCM
2. mvn release:perform -> deploys artifacts from tag 
NOTE: it does NOT deploy site
3. Manually deploy site docs by copying from distribution/target/site to https://dav.codehaus.org/picocontainer
NOTE: Ben Walding will be posting update of SOAP4R to avoid dav-access http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/HAUS-1704

Note:  Releasing/deploying on Mac/Intel with SVN 1.4 is affected by http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-3361 (Brett's hack works though).
All is working fine with SVN 1.5 and OS X 10.5.3.
