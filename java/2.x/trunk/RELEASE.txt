RELEASE STEPS

0.  mvn -Preporting,distribution install (practice) 

NOTE .. there's some problem in the distribution so maybe just do 'release' without the two profiles

1. mvn -Preporting,distribution release:prepare -> verifies dependencies and tags release in SCM.  
NOTE: the reporting,distribution profiles MUST be activated during the prepare stage for distribution archives to be included in the release

2. mvn  -Preporting,distribution release:perform -> deploys artifacts from tag 
NOTE: it only deploys site for the distribution modules

3. The site can be manually deployed by invoking from distribution module: 
mvn site-deploy
