<h2>Why PicoContainer Logging?</h2>
<p><a href="http://picocontainer.org">PicoContainer</a>'s primary mission statement is to provide an Inversion of
Control (IoC) container for components honor the Dependency Injection (DI) pattern. Logging is an important and useful function of
many enterprise-level applications.  Yet the logging tools and frameworks available remain stubborly wed to the static lookup 
and discovery approach that defies the concepts of IoC and DI.
