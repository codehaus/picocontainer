<h2>Why PicoContainer Logging?</h2>
<p><a href="http://picocontainer.org">PicoContainer</a>'s primary
mission statement is to provide an Inversion of Control (IoC) container
for components honor the Dependency Injection (DI) pattern. Logging is
an important and useful function of many enterprise-level applications.
Yet the logging tools and frameworks available remain stubborly wed to
the static lookup and discovery approach that defies the concepts of IoC
and DI. The main problem with static lookup is that it allows only one
configuration per JVM, even if there are completely different
applications deployed. To compound problems, static lookup is often
coupled with auto-discovery mechanisms of which logging framework is
deployed by looking for classes in the classpath. This makes it
impossible to use a chosen logging framework per application, as would
be expected of any configurable system.</p>

<p>Following the general PicoContainer philosophy, we strife to
interoperate and are not trying to propose an alternative logging
facade. Rather, we propose an alternative approach to logging, based on
the <a href="monitor-pattern.html">Monitor pattern</a> to abstract the
dependency on <i>any</i> logging framework.</p>
