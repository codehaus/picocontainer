<title>Monitor Pattern</title></head>
<body>
<p>A Monitor is an interface that abstract certain events that are relevant to the business domain of then application.  It should express 
the business logic of the events being monitored.  
</p>
<p>Although monitors can have implementations of very different types, one of the most common is a logging implementation.  This also helps 
to avoid the logging framework references are sprinkled all over the code.  Instead, keeping the logging implementation centralised in one
abstract monitor allows not only to swiftly change from one logging framework to another - should the need arise - but also to easily provide
for, say, localisation of the logged messages.
