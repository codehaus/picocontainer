Build system: 

JDK required: 1.5+
Maven (http://maven.apache.org) required: 2.0.8+

Build profiles:  

- default: builds all releasable modules
- reporting:  builds reports and javadoc/source attachment of artifacts
- distribution:  builds distribution
- nt: no-test, builds skipping unit tests 

Note:  profiles are additive and the default profile is always active.
Eg, build with reporting and distribution:

mvn -Preporting,distribution install

Note:  Releasing/deploying on Mac is affected by
http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-3361
Brett's hack works though.
