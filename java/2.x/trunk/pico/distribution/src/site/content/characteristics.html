<h2>Characteristics   </h2>
<p>DefaultPicoContainer allows for some characteristics to be set per component at the time each is added. There is a convenience class on which supplied characteristics are specified. It is called Characterizations. You can use them via static imports or long-name them.</p>
<p>Characteristics can be set for a component in a method 'as' on MutablePicoContainer. If that is the case then the charactistics will affect the next component added only. </p>
<p>They can also be set in a more persistent manner for the MutablePicoContainer in question. If so, they will affect all subsequent additions of component.</p>
<p>Some examples : </p>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><div class="source">
  <pre>
import static org.picocontainer.Characterizations.SDI;
import static org.picocontainer.Characterizations.CACHE;
...
pico = new DefaultPicoContainer();
pico.as(CACHE).addComponent(Apple.class);
pico.as(CACHE, SDI).addComponent(Pear.class);
</pre>
</div></td>
    <td><div class="source">
  <pre>import static org.picocontainer.Characterizations.SDI;
import static org.picocontainer.Characterizations.CACHE;
...<br />pico = new DefaultPicoContainer();
pico.change(CACHE).addComponent(Apple.class);
pico.change(SDI).addComponent(Pear.class);</pre>
</div></td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><div class="source">
  <pre>
pico = new DefaultPicoContainer();
pico.as(Characterizations.CACHE).addComponent(Apple.class);
pico.as(Characterizations.CACHE, 
    Characterizations.SDI).addComponent(Pear.class);
</pre>
</div></td>
    <td><div class="source">
  <pre>pico = new DefaultPicoContainer();
pico.change(Characterizations.CACHE).addComponent(Apple.class);
pico.change(Characterizations.SDI).addComponent(Pear.class);</pre>
</div></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Some characteristics are mutually exclusive.  For example CDI, SDI. Meaning the last one set via 'as' or 'change' rules. Others are additive like CACHE and 
  HIDE. It is not important the order of things.</p>
<h3>Appropriate Behavior and Injection Factories. </h3>
<p>Every characteristics set for a component must be handled by a BehaviorFactory or InjectionFactory that recognises it. They are typically chained together. DefaultPicoContainer's default BehaviorFactory and InjectionFactory are AdaptiveBehaviorFactory and AdaptiveInjectionFactory. These can handle CDI and SDI as well as CACHE and HIDE.</p>
<p>If you setup DefaultPicoContainer with a BehaviorFactory/InjectionFactory combination that is unaware of the characteristics you subsequently use, Pico will object by way of an exception as you add the component. </p>
