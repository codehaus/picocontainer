<title>Goals of PicoContainer project</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>PicoContainer's core was designed with some goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No mandatory dependencies.</li>
  <li>No logging built in (we have a Monitor interface and implementations for Commons-Logging and Log4J etc)</li>
  <li>No meta-data requirement.</li>
  <li>Small jar size.</li>
  <li>Embeddable by design (no main method entry point)</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone has a need for PicoContainer that we did not originally envision, or a feature that could be imlemented, we will try to accomodate it. The principle of Lowest Common Denominator (LCD) allows us for PicoContainer itself, to keep things small, while allowing extensions to deliver the larger visions. Thus, meta-data, dependancies, mainable are all OK for related extensions to PicoContainer.</p>
