<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>PicoContainer is a lightweight and highly embeddable container for components that honour the Dependency Injection pattern.</p>
<p>See PicoContainer Overview for an introduction to PicoContainer.</p>
<p>Want something easier to get you started? Have a look at our Tutorials.</p>
<p>Despite it being very compact in size (the core is ~100K and it has no mandatory dependencies outside the JDK),<br />
  PicoContainer supports different dependency injection types (both CDI and SDI) and offers totally customisable lifecycles</p>
<p>PicoContainer has originally been implemented in Java but is also available for other platforms and<br />
  languages. These are detailed in Ports.</p>
