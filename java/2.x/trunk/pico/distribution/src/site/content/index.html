<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>PicoContainer is a lightweight and highly embeddable container
for components that honour the Dependency Injection pattern.</p>
<p>What is Dependency Injection? Martin Fowler has a good <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">article</a> from 2003, but here is another view: It is a good design pattern
that for large enterprise applications promotes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>testability</li>
  <li>clean &amp; declarative architecture</li>
  <li>maintainability </li>
  <li>adaptibilty</li>
</ul>
<p>It is
  quite often, but not exclusively, used by Agile practicioners. It
  counters the situation where the enterprise application:</p>
<ul>
  <li>has grown to be thousands of classes, with dozens if not
  hundreds of Singletons</li>
  <li>draws similarities to Spaghetti, Hairballs or <a href="for large enterprise applications">Balls of Mud</a></li>
  <li>has made development staff looking after it miserable</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite it being very compact in size (the core is ~130K and it
has no mandatory dependencies outside the JDK), PicoContainer supports different dependency injection types (Constructor, Setter, Annotated Field and Method) and offers multiple lifecycle and monitoring strategies.</p>
<p>PicoContainer has originally been implemented in Java but is also
available for other platforms and languages. These are detailed in TODO.</p>

several scripting meta-languages (XML, Groovy, Bsh, Jython and Rhyno),
AOP, Web frameworks (Struts and WebWork), Persistence (Hibernate) SOAP,
JMX, and much more.</p>
