<h2>What is PicoContainer?</h2>
<p>PicoContainer is a highly embeddable full service Inversion of
Control (IoC) container
for components honour the Dependency Injection pattern.</p>
<p>You could use it as a lightweight alternative to Sun's J2EE
patterns for web applications or general solutions. </p>
<p>What is Dependency Injection? Martin Fowler has a good <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">article</a>
from 2003, but here is another view: It is a good design pattern that,
for large enterprise applications, facilitates: </p>
<ul>
<li>easy best practice unit testing vs little and difficult
unit testing. </li>
<li>component reuse vs rewriting through ignorance or need </li>
<li>centralized configuration vs components reading their own
config (scattered) </li>
<li>clean &amp; declarative architecture vs nest of
singletons that nobody can make sense of </li>
<li>maintainability vs developers having difficulties fixing
bugs </li>
<li>adaptability vs developers not knowing where to start to
add features</li>
</ul>
<p>Dependency Injection is quite often, but not exclusively, used
by Agile practicioners. It counters the situation where the enterprise
application:</p>
<ul>
<li>has grown to be thousands of classes, with dozens if not
hundreds of Singletons</li>
<li>draws similarities to Spaghetti, Hairballs or <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/">Balls of Mud</a></li>
<li>has made development staff looking after it miserable</li>
<li>suffers repeated allegations of being unable to be
developed without complete rewrite </li>
</ul>
<p>Despite it being very compact in size (the core is ~128K and
it
has no mandatory dependencies outside the JDK), PicoContainer supports
different dependency injection types (Constructor, Setter, Annotated
Field / Method) and offers multiple lifecycle and monitoring
strategies.</p>
<p>PicoContainer has originally been implemented in Java but is
also
available for other platforms and languages. These are detailed <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/PICO/Ports">here</a>.</p>

The <a href="introduction.html">Introduction</a> page discusses basic PicoContainer usage, and has pictures - yay!

<p><a href="http://www.nanocontainer.org">NanoContainer</a>
builds on top of PicoContainer the support for
several scripting meta-languages (XML, Groovy, Bsh, Jython and Rhyno),
AOP, Web frameworks (Struts and WebWork), Persistence (Hibernate) SOAP,
JMX, and much more.</p>
