<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>PicoContainer is a lightweight and highly embeddable container
for components that honour the Dependency Injection pattern.</p>
<p>What is Dependency Injection? Martin Fowler has a good article at
zzz from 2003, but here is another view: It is a good design pattern
that promotes Testability, clean declarative architecture,
Maintainability, Adaptibilty for large enterprise applications. It is
quite often, but not exclusively, used by Agile practicioners. It
counters the situation where an enterprise application:</p>
<ul>
  <li>has grown to be thousands of classes, with dozens if not
  hundreds of Singletons</li>
  <li>draws similarities to Spaghetti, Hairballs or Balls of Mud</li>
  <li>has made development staff looking after it miserable</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite it being very compact in size (the core is ~130K and it
has no mandatory dependencies outside the JDK),<br />
PicoContainer supports different dependency injection types (both CDI
and SDI) and offers totally customisable lifecycles</p>
<p>PicoContainer has originally been implemented in Java but is also
available for other platforms and<br />
languages. These are detailed in Ports.</p>

<p>NanoContainer builds on top of PicoContainer the support for
several scripting meta-languages (XML, Groovy, Bsh, Jython and Rhyno),
AOP, Web frameworks (Struts and WebWork), Persistence (Hibernate) SOAP,
JMX, and much more.</p>
