<p>See Martin Fowlers's <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">Inversion
    of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection patten</a> article
    from 2003 for a thorough description. Surely everyone has read this by
    now?</p>

<p>Very
    quickly: Dependency Injection is where components are given their
    dependencies through their constructors, methods, or directly into
    fields. Those components do not get their dependencies
    themselves, or instantiate them directly. This is very much
    related to the encompassing design principle <a href="inversion-of-control.html">Inversion of Control</a>.

<h2>Different types of Dependency Injection supported by
    PicoContainer </h2>

<p>PicoContainer
    supports multiple ways to specify the injection of dependencies into
    components. Constructor injection (listed first) is the
    recomended idiom for PicoContainer. Other types leverage
    fields
    and methods. Variations of the method types, can follow a
    naming
    convention or be marked with an annotation.Dependencies for
    those could be populated one by one, or all in one method call. Indeed
    components could be populated with combinations of Constructor, Method
    and Field Injection.</p>
