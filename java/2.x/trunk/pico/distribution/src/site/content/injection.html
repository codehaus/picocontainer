<p>See Martin Fowlers's <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection</a>  article from 2003 for a thorough description. Surely everyone has read this by now?</p><p>Very
quickly: Dependency Injection is where components are given their
dependencies through their constructors, methods, or directly into
fields. &nbsp;Those components do not get their dependencies
themselves, or instantiate them directly. &nbsp;This is very much
related to the encompassing design principle <a href="inversion-of-control.html">Inversion of Control</a>.  </p>
<h2>Different types of Dependency Injection supported by PicoContainer </h2><p>PicoContainer
supports multiple ways to specify the injection of dependencies into
components. &nbsp;Constructor injection (listed first) is the
recomended idiom for PicoContainer. &nbsp;Other types leverage fields
and methods. &nbsp;Variations of the method types, can follow a naming
convention or be marked with an annotation. &nbsp;Dependencies for
those could be populated one by one, or all in one method call. Indeed
components could be populated with combinations of Constructor, Method
and Field Injection.</p>
<h3>Constructor&nbsp;Injection </h3>
<p>This is where a component has a constructor, with arguments that are its dependencies:</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>public class Apple {
  private final Orange orange;
  private final Pear pear;
  private final Banana banana;
	
  public Apple(<u>Orange</u> orange, <u>Pear</u> pear, <u>Banana</u> banana) {
    this.orange = orange;
    this.pear = pear;
    this.banana = banana;
  }
		
  // methods
}</pre></div>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<div class="source">
  <pre>pico = new DefaultPicoContainer(new ConstructorInjection());
pico.addComponent(Apple.class);
// etc
Apple apple = pico.getComponent(Apple.class);</pre>
</div>
<p>Constructor Injection, is a default too (via AdaptiveInjection):</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>pico = new DefaultPicoContainer();
pico.addComponent(Apple.class);
// etc
Apple apple = pico.getComponent(Apple.class);</pre>
</div>

<p>
The PicoContainer team recommends Constructor Dependency Injection
(CDI) over other types - the project was started to pioneer this
approach. With PicoContainer is no need
to mark up the constructor with an annotation. Having more than one
constructor is OK too, as PicoContainer will try to use the one with
the most arguments and fall back to ones with fewer if it cannot
satisfy the longer ones.</p>
<p>The  component factory for this is <strong>ConstructorInjection</strong>. It only handles constructor injection types of components.  Factory <strong>AdaptiveInjection</strong>
defaults to constructor injection, after checking first to see it the
component in question is a Annotated Method or Field type (see below).</p><p class="callout">Constructor Injection is idiomatic PicoContainer
- choose this style over all others if you can - especially if you are
starting out with Dependency Injection.&nbsp;  </p>
<h3>Injecting into Setter Methods </h3>
<p>This is where a component has an empty constructor with dependencies provided by setters after instantiation:</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>public class Apple {
  private Orange orange;
  private Pear pear;
  private Banana banana;	
  public <u>set</u>Orange(<u>Orange</u> orange) {
    this.orange = orange;
  }		
  public <u>set</u>Pear(<u>Pear</u> pear) {
    this.pear = pear;
  }
  public <u>set</u>Banana(<u>Banana</u> banana) {
    this.banana = banana;
  }
  // other methods
}</pre>
</div>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<div class="source">
  <pre>pico = new DefaultPicoContainer(new SetterInjection());
pico.addComponent(Apple.class);
// etc
Apple apple = pico.getComponent(Apple.class);</pre>
</div>
<p>If you want to use an prefix other than 'set'...</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>pico = new DefaultPicoContainer(new SetterInjection("mySynonymForSet"));
pico.addComponent(Apple.class);
// etc
Apple apple = pico.getComponent(Apple.class);</pre>
</div>
  <p>Setter methods (those prefixed with 'set') may not be your
preferred choice. You can force a different prefix to be choosable in
PicoContainer, such as 'init' or 'inject'.</p>
  <p>The  component factory for this is <strong>SetterInjection</strong>. It only handles setter injection types of components.</p>
<p>Factory <strong>AdaptiveInjection</strong> can also handle setter injection types, though it requires that the component was registered with the <a href="properties.html">property</a> 'SDI' in order to activate the Setter Injection functionality. <strong>AdaptiveInjection</strong> will also fall through to constructor injection if there is no SDI property. </p>

<h3>Injecting into Annotated Fields &nbsp; </h3>
<p>This is where a component has an empty constructor with dependencies
indicated by a field annotation and provided automatically by the
container after instantiation.</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>public class Apple {
  <u>@Inject</u>
  private <u>Orange</u> orange;
  <u>@Inject</u>
  private <u>Pear</u> pear;
  <u>@Inject</u>
  private <u>Banana</u> banana;
  // methods
}</pre>
</div>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<div class="source">
  <pre>pico = new DefaultPicoContainer(new AnnotatedFieldInjection();
pico.addComponent(Apple.class); 
// etc
Apple apple = pico.getComponent(Apple.class);</pre>
</div>
<p>With an custom annotation instead of PicoContainer's @Inject</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>pico = new DefaultPicoContainer(new AnnotatedFieldInjection(MyInjectAnnotaton.class);
pico.addComponent(Apple.class);
// etc
Apple apple = pico.getComponent(Apple.class);</pre>
</div>

<p>
Yes that's right, there's no constructor needed. It means that for a
Unit Test, you cannot simply 'new' the class without some magic to populate the dependency fields.</p>
<p>The  component factory for this is a class<strong> AnnotatedFieldInjection</strong>. It only handles annotation-field injection for components.</p>
<p>Additionally the default component factory <strong>AdaptiveInjection</strong>
can also handle field annotation types, if the @Inject annotation from
PicoContainer's code-base is used as the marker for injection. <strong>AdaptiveInjection</strong> will also fall through to constructor injection if there is no recognized @Inject annotation.</p>
<h3>Injecting into Typed Fields &nbsp; </h3>
<p>This is where a component has an empty constructor with dependencies
indicated by a on a per component basis with an array of field-types to be injected into. These will be provided automatically by the
container after instantiation.</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>public class Apple {
  private <u>Orange</u> orange;
  private <u>Pear</u> pear;
  private <u>Banana</u> banana;
  // methods
}</pre>
</div>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<div class="source">
  <pre>import static org.picocontainer.injectors.TypedFieldInjection.injectionFieldTypes;
	pico = new DefaultPicoContainer(new TypedFieldInjection();
pico.as(injectionFieldTypes(<u>Orange.class</u>, <u>Pear.class</u>, <u>Banana.class</u>)).addComponent(Apple.class);
// etc
Apple apple = pico.getComponent(Apple.class);</pre>
</div>

<p>
Yes that's right, there's no constructor needed. It means that for a
Unit Test, you cannot simply 'new' the class without some magic to populate the dependency fields.</p>
<p>The  component factory for this is a class<strong> TypedFieldInjection</strong>. It only handles typed-field injection for components.</p>

<h3>Injecting into Named Fields &nbsp; </h3>
<p>This is where a component has an empty constructor with dependencies
indicated by a on a per component basis with an array of field-names to be injected into. These will be provided automatically by the
container after instantiation.</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>public class Apple {
  private Orange <u>orange</u>;
  private Pear <u>pear</u>;
  private Banana <u>banana</u>;
  // methods
}</pre>
</div>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<div class="source">
  <pre>import static org.picocontainer.injectors.NamedFieldInjection.injectionFieldNames;
	pico = new DefaultPicoContainer(new NamedFieldInjection();
pico.as(injectionFieldNames("<u>orange</u>", "<u>pear</u>", "<u>banana</u>")).addComponent(Apple.class);
// etc
Apple apple = pico.getComponent(Apple.class);</pre>
</div>

<h3>Injecting into Annotated Methods&nbsp; </h3>
<p>This is where a component has an empty constructor and gets its
dependencies injected into annotated methods after instantiation:</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>public class Apple {
  private Orange orange;
  private Pear pear;
  private Banana banana;

  <u>@Inject</u>
  public injectOrange(<u>Orange</u> orange) {
    this.orange = orange;
  }
  <u>@Inject</u>
  public setPear(<u>Pear</u> pear) {
    this.pear = pear;
  }
  <u>@Inject</u>
  public provideBanana(Banana banana) {
    this.banana = banana;
  }
  // other methods
}</pre>
</div>
<h4>Usage</h4>

<div class="source">
  <pre>pico = new DefaultPicoContainer(new AnnotatedMethodInjection();
pico.addComponent(Apple.class);
// etc
Apple apple = pico.getComponent(Apple.class);</pre>
</div>
<p>With an custom annotation instead of PicoContainer's @Inject</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>pico = new DefaultPicoContainer(new AnnotatedMethodInjection(MyInjectAnnotaton.class);
pico.addComponent(Apple.class);
// etc
Apple apple = pico.getComponent(Apple.class);</pre>
</div>


<p>The method (whatever its name) needs an @Inject annotation.  That is from our codebase (org.picocontainer.Inject).</p>
<p>The  component factory for this is <strong>AnnotatedMethodInjection</strong>. It only handles method-annotation injection types of components.</p>
<p>Additionally the default component factory <strong>AdaptiveInjection</strong>
can also handle method-annotation injection types, if the @Inject
annotation from PicoContainer's code-base is used as the marker for
injection. AdaptiveInjection will also fall through to constructor
injection if there is no recognized annotation.</p>

<h3>Injecting into a Single Method&nbsp; </h3>
<p>This is where a component has an empty constructor and gets <span style="font-weight: bold;">all</span> its
dependencies injected into single method after instantiation:</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>public class Apple {
  private Orange orange;
  private Pear pear;
  private Banana banana;
  public <u>inject</u>(<u>Orange</u> orange, <u>Pear</u> pear, <u>Banana</u> banana) {
    this.orange = orange;
    this.pear = pear;
    this.banana = banana;
  }
  // other methods
}</pre>
</div>
<h4>Usage</h4>

<div class="source">
  <pre>pico = new DefaultPicoContainer(new MethodInjection();
pico.addComponent(Apple.class);
// etc
Apple apple = pico.getComponent(Apple.class);</pre>
</div>
<p>Custom injection method prefix:</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>pico = new DefaultPicoContainer(new MethodInjection("mySynonymForInject");
pico.addComponent(Apple.class);
// etc
Apple apple = pico.getComponent(Apple.class);</pre>
</div>
<p>Via the default AdaptiveInjection Method injection, via a characteristic:</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>pico = new DefaultPicoContainer();
pico.as(Characteristics.METHOD_INJECTION).addComponent(Apple.class);
// etc
Apple apple = pico.getComponent(Apple.class);
</pre>
</div>


<p>The method name needs be 'inject' unless overridden in the InjectionFactory.</p>
<p>The  component factory for this is <strong>MethodInjection</strong>. It only handles method-injection types of components.</p>
<p>Additionally the default component factory <strong>AdaptiveInjection</strong> can also handle method-injection types, but only if the METHOD_INJECTION characteristic is specified.</p>
<h3> Muli-type Dependency Injection </h3>
<p>This is where a component has is a blend of one or more of Constructor, Setter, Method, Annotated Field etc:</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>public class Apple {
  private Orange orange;
  private Pear pear;
  <u>@Inject</u>
  private <u>Banana</u> banana;
  public <u>inject</u>(<u>Orange</u> orange) {
    this.orange = orange;
  public void <u>inject</u>Pear(<u>Pear</u> pear) {
    this.pear = pear;
  }
  // other methods
}</pre>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;In the case above, Orange comes in through the constructor,
Pear by method injection and Banana is via Annotated Field Injection.</p>
<p>The  component factory for this is <strong>MultiInjection</strong>. It only handles method-injection types of components.</p>
<p>Additionally the default component factory <strong>AdaptiveInjection</strong> can also handle method-injection types, but only if the MULTI_INJECTION characteristic is specified.</p>

<h2> Leveraging Parameter Names </h2>
<p>This is where the type alone is not enough to indicate which
dependency should be put one or more constructor args. The following
component has a need for two of the same type, with some subtly
different characteristics.</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>public class AppleProcessor {
  private Apple dessertApple;
  private Apple cookingApple;

  public inject(Apple dessertApple, Apple cookingApple) {
    this.dessertApple = dessertApple;
    this.cookingApple = cookingApple;
  }
  // other methods
}

pico.addComponent("dessertApple", GoldenDeliciousApple.class);
pico.addComponent("cookingApple", BramleyApple.class);
pico.as(Characteristics.USE_NAMES).addComponent(AppleProcessor.class);

AppleProcessor appleProcessor = pico.getComponent(AppleProcessor.class);</pre>
</div>
<p>In this case the constructor to AppleProcessor has carefully named
parameters - 'dessertApple' and 'cookingApple'. This is picked up on
for the two named components GoldenDeliciousApple and BramleyApple also
set up in the container.</p>
<p>There are two ways for this to work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>relying on the fact that  your component classes have debug info compiled into them. </li>
  <li>post-processing component classes with <a href="http://paranamer.codehaus.org/">Paranamer</a> before placing them in their jar </li>
</ul>
