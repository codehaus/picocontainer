<p><strong>November xx, 2008</strong></p>
<p>PicoContainer 2.7 released (269K jar) </p>
<p>New (since 2.6):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provider added as a type of Injector.  Subclasses of this supply one method called provide that takes
        dependencies and returns an instance of the type it is trying to provide</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes (versus 2.6):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reinjection changed to allow access to the result in the reinjection method invocation</li>
    <li>Method decorateComponentInstance on Injector changed to have a return code</li>
</ul>

<p>PicoContainer 2.6 released (265K jar) </p>

<p>New (since 2.5.1):</p>
<ul>
    <li>CompositeLifecycleStrategy supports a mix of LifecycleStrategies in one container tree</li>
    <li>Method Injection changed to also allow a specific reflection method to be implicated</li>
    <li>Reinjection added to allow components to be injected into a second time (reflection method injection only)</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes (versus 2.5.1):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Permissions fix for AdaptingInjection</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Aug 14, 2008</strong></p>

<p>PicoContainer 2.5.1 released (255K jar) </p>

<p>Changes (versus 2.5):</p>
<ul>
    <li>makeChildContainer passes componentMonitor to the child container.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>July 25, 2008</strong></p>

<p>PicoContainer 2.5 released (255K jar) </p>

<p>New (since 2.4):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Circular dependencies, while always supported via the implementation hiding behavior are now supported
        explicitly for individual components
    </li>
    <li>PicoBuilder improved in that it can add child containers to their parents if wanted. Refer
        PicoBuilder.addChildToParent()
    </li>
    <li>Components can now declare generic collections as dependencies to be Injected. It works the same was as an Array
        of the type in question always did.
    </li>
    <li>Concrete extensions of generic components can satisfy dependencies now. This is <i>a</i> way of beating type
        erasure.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Changes (versus 2.4):</p>
<ul>
    <li>ConsoleComponentMonitor does need to be final, thus is not now.</li>
    <li>Attempts to chain a series of MutablePicoContainer.as() statements are blocked now. Instead users are directed
        towards the varargs feature of the same method.
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>May 9, 2008</strong></p>

<p>PicoContainer 2.2 released (224K jar) </p>

<p>New (since 2.1):</p>
<ul>
    <li>A new TieringPicoContainer that when used in a container tree, forbids children from seeking dependencies from
        their grandparents (they can only seek such from their parents)
    </li>
    <li>A new ReusablePicoContainer that is 2.5x faster for some niche usages where you are repeatedly discarding a
        container and then repopulating it (Gems)
    </li>
    <li>NamedFieldInjection allows named fields to be injected into (per component) - use when AnnotatedFieldInjection
        is not what you want
    </li>
    <li>TypedFieldInjection allows fields of a specified type to be injected into (per component) - use when
        AnnotatedFieldInjection is not what you want
    </li>
    <li>CompositeInjection allows a very custom setup of what injection-types you want your instance to support. Use
        when speed of execution is of the essence and AdaptiveInjection is not
        right for you.
    </li>
    <li>Decorating (behavior factory) - do something to a component instance immediately after its instantiation (and
        formal injection)
    </li>
    <li>FactoryAdapter - Allows for a custom instance to be injected into a component. E.g. 'new Logger(Foo.class)' for
        a Logger type and a Foo instance being the injectee
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Changes (versus 2.1):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Teams embedding PicoContainer and (completely hiding it from user communities) can extend
        StartableLifecycleStrategy and provide their own Startable interface (was buggy)
    </li>
</ul>

<br/><br/>
<span class="callout">April, 2007:
Work begins on PicoContainer 2.x.  It is substantially a refactoring of the PicoContainer 1.x codeline using the inbuilt
    features of Intellij IDEA and Eclipse.  Using the existing unit tests as a guide, many small commits were made to
    the code-base to take PicoContainer in a more JDK 1.5 direction, and add in other features not seen in competing
    containers like parameter name access. Along the way, the API was simplified and parts of NanoContainer were bought
    closer to the core of PicoContainer.</span>

<p>PicoContainer split into a core jar and 'gems' for things less often used</p>

<p><strong>January 23, 2004</strong></p>

<p>PicoContainer 1.0 beta-4 (64K jar) </p>

<p><strong>November 03, 2003</strong></p>

<p>PicoContainer 1.0 beta-3 (52K jar) </p>

<p><strong>September 10, 2003</strong></p>

<p>PicoContainer 1.0 beta-2 (44K jar) </p>

<p><strong>August 14, 2003</strong></p>

<p>PicoContainer 1.0 beta-1 (39K jar) </p>

<p><strong>July 17, 2003</strong></p>

<p>PicoContainer 1.0 alpha-2 (36K jar) </p>

<p>Setter Injection added (this was after the Pico team learned of the Spring-Framework project, Spring did not add
    Constructor Injection until the run up to 1.0-Milestone-3 in November '03 and 'autowiring' in the run up to
    1-0-Milestone-4 in January of '04)

<p><strong>June 29, 2003</strong></p>

<p>PicoContainer 1.0 alpha-1 (25K jar) </p>

<p>Generalized Constructor Injection available for the first time. This was very much PicoContainer's idiom. ATG Dynamo
    had something similar for web components, but Pico released this first as a general embedable API for the Java
    world. Goals for Pico are a) lightweight/embeddable, b) no XML or meta-data - 'autowiring' only, c) no lock-in, d)
    popularize Constructor Injection over Avalon and OSGi style of IoC, e) no dependencies for the container itself.</p>

<p>PicoContainer experimentation begins</p>
