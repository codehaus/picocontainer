<p>PicoContainer 2.4 released (241K jar) </p>
<p>New (since 2.3):</p>
<ul>
	<li>Locking behaviors are now characterizable as LOCK and NO_LOCK</li>
	<li>Synchronizing behaviors are now characterizable as SYNCHRONIZE and NO_SYNCHRONIZE</li>
	<li>Pooling behaviors are now characterizable as NO_POOLED and POOLED</li>
	<li>Assimilating behaviors are now characterizable as NO_POOLED and POOLED</li>
	<li>HotSwapping behaviors are now characterizable as NO_POOLED and POOLED</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes (versus 2.2):</p>
<ul>
	<li>Visitor for trees of PicoContainers, can issue a halt instruction now to stop the visitation early</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>June 26, 2008</strong></p>
<p>PicoContainer 2.4 released (241K jar) </p>
<p>New (since 2.3):</p>
<ul>
	<li>FactoryInjector implementations for Log4J, Commons-logging, Java-Logging and SL4FJ</li>
	<li>JSR-250 compatible (@PreDestroy and @PostConstruct) lifecycle strategy</li>
	<li>Slf4j based component monitor</li>
	<li>Visitor for component factories (PICO-221)</li>
	<li>Thread local Storing behavior now has a mechanism to report the store size</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes (versus 2.2):</p>
<ul>
	<li>Implementation-hiding Behavior has a bug PICO-310 that has been fixed</li>
	<li>FactoryInjection bug fixed - PICO-311</li>
	<li>Embedded Paranamer now upgraded to 1.1.3</li>
	<li>Some of the monitors are now serializable when they were not formerly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>May 9, 2008</strong></p>
<p>PicoContainer 2.2 released (224K jar) </p>
<p>New (since 2.1):</p>
<ul>
	<li>A new TieringPicoContainer that when used in a container tree, forbids children from seeking dependencies from their grandparents (they can only seek such from their parents)</li>
	<li>A new ReusablePicoContainer that is 2.5x faster for some niche usages where you are repeatedly discarding a container and then repopulating it (Gems)</li>
	<li>NamedFieldInjection allows named fields to be injected into (per component) - use when AnnotatedFieldInjection is not what you want</li>
	<li>TypedFieldInjection allows fields of a specified type to be injected into (per component) - use when AnnotatedFieldInjection is not what you want</li>
	<li>CompositeInjection allows a very custom setup of what injection-types you want your instance to support. Use when speed of execution is of the essence and AdaptiveInjection is not 
		right for you.</li>
	<li>Decorating (behavior factory) - do something to a component instance immediately after its instantiation (and formal injection)</li>
	<li>FactoryAdapter - Allows for a custom instance to be injected into a component. E.g. 'new Logger(Foo.class)' for a Logger type and a Foo instance being the injectee</li>	
</ul>
<p>Changes (versus 2.1):</p>
<ul>
	<li>Teams embedding PicoContainer and (completely hiding it from user communities) can extend StartableLifecycleStrategy and provide their own Startable interface (was buggy)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mar 31, 2008</strong></p>
<p>PicoContainer 2.1 released (194K jar) </p>
<p>New (since 2.0):</p>

<p><strong>Jan 19, 2008</strong></p>
<p>PicoContainer 2.0 released (190K jar) </p>

<ul>
  <li>Binding Annotations support (disambiguation)</li>
  <li>Newer and rewritten properties backed containers</li>
  <li>Parameter names can be leveraged for all relevant types of injection</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes (versus 2.0-beta-2):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yet More Java5 generics</li>
  <li>Build moved to JUnit 4.x and JMock 2.x (does not affect users of PicoContainer)</li>
  <li>Built-in parameter name access, as opposed jar dependency</li>
</ul>

  <li>Store behavior (can extract/replace component store per thread)</li>
  <li>Automatic components (instantiate irrespective of need)</li>
  <li>Reentrant-Lock version of Synchronizing behavior</li>
</ul>

  <li>Parameters names for constructors can now drive otherwise ambiguous injections, as well as configuration</li>
  <li>Large sets of configuration can be taken from properties files and command line arguments</li>
  <li>PicoBuilder to make a container with desired behavior. </li>
