<title>Reinjection</title></head>

<body>
<p>Reinjection is where an existing instance, that may have been already created by PicoContainer, can have a method called to inject more dependancies.</p>

<h2>Direct Reinjection via 'Reinjector'</h2>
<p>Consider the following example of class that could benefit from reinjection:</p>
<div class="source"><pre>public class ShoppingCart {
  private Store store;
  private User user;
  public ShoppingCart(Store store, User user) {
    this.store = store;
    this.user = user;
  }
  public boolean addItemTo(Make make, Model model, int quantity) {
	Cart cart = store.getCart(user);
	if (cart.contains(make, model)) {
		cart.for(make, model).increaseQuantity(quantity);
	} else {
		cart.addItem(make, model, quantity);
	}
	return true;
  }
}
</pre></div>
<p>The class would be instantiated and have 'store' and 'user' satisfied via constructor injection.  Later, perhaps corresponding to a web request, addItemTo could be invoked with relevant parameters. Indeed the addItemTo method could be called many times after instantiation.</p>
<p>And here is a fragment of Java showing reinjection in use:</p>
<div class="source"><pre>addItemMethod = ShoppingCart.class.getMethods()[0]; // a poor way to select a method!
reinjector = new Reinjector(picoContainer);
boolean result = (Boolean) reinjector.reinject(ShoppingCart.class, addItemMethod);
</pre></div>
<p>In the above example, the PicoContainer instance (or one of its parents) can inject a Make, a Model and a quantity (int / Integer).</p>
<p>For reinjection to work, you really need to know the exact method to be injected into. You indicate which method by a reflection method reference (as in the example above), or by method name ("addItemTo" should be unique in the class).  You could also rely on an @Inject annotation, but that only makes sense where there is one method in the class to be used in this way.  If you are implicating a reinjection method by name (rather than reflection method reference), and there are more than one matching, then the last one invoked will have it's return value returned to the caller.</p>
<h2>Reinjection as a type of regular Injection</h2>
<p>This is where reinjection is managed by a PicoContainer instance, rather than directly.</p>
<pre>public class ShoppingCart {
  List<Item> list = new ArrayList<Item>();
  public void addItemTo(Make make, Model model, int quantity) {
	list.add(new Item(make, model, quantity));
  }
}
...
addItemMethod = ShoppingCart.class.getMethods()[0]
pico = new TransientPicoContainer(new Reinjection(new MethodInjection(addItemMethod), parent), parent);
cart = pico.getComponent(ShoppingCart.class);
</pre></div>
<p>The method addItemTo() is called during the getComponent() invocation.  This works because the return type is void.  A non-void type would cause getComponent() to fail with a class cast exception.  If you have that component design need, you need to use the Reinjector directly. </p>
