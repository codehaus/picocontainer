<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Setter Dependency Injection (SDI) is where the container or embedder hands dependencies to a component via setter
   methods after instantiation.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Joe Walnes whist working on Java Open Source Programming with other luminaries, started with a Setter Injection
   IoC design for WebWork2. This is marked up with doclet tags (though that was not hard and fast) :</p>

<div class="source">
            <pre>public class Shop {
   StockManager stockManager;
   String shopZipCode;
   /**
    * @service name=&quot;StockManager&quot;
    */
   public void setStockManager(StockManager stockManager) {
       this.stockManager = stockManager;
   }
   /**
    * @config name=&quot;shopZipCode&quot;
    */
   public void setStockManager(String shopZipCode) {
       this.shopZipCode= shopZipCode;
   }
   // TODO - Joe - how does setter injector do config ? Same way?
   public void initialize() {
       // all setXXXs are now done :-)
   }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>The container use the meta-information to resolve all the dependencies. Components need not be interface/impl
   separated. Developer's choice.</p>

       id="SetterInjection-UsingSetterInjectorComponentsWithoutaContainer."></a>Using Setter Injector Components
                                                                                Without a Container.</h3>

<p>Setter Injection components can be used directly, without any container. The component-using class will
   continue to compile, but at run time it will be apparent that there are missing dependencies. The downside of
   this is that a developer may miss a setXXX(..) method invocation if they are using the component directly.
   That is fairly small as a risk as it would clearly be caught in the development cycle. Caught in the
   development cycle, but maybe obscurely so with a NullPointerException.</p>

<div class="source">
              <pre>Shop shop = new Shop();
shop.setStockManager(myStockManager);</pre>
</div>
<h2>Container support</h2>

<p>The Spring Framework project is the best example of a container that favors setter injection. PicoContainer does
   too, but we really believe that constructor injector is superior.</p>

<p>The advantage of <a href="constructor-injection.html" title="Constructor Injection">Constructor Injection</a> is
   that the setting is atomic in a sense that either all or none of the dependencies are set and that it can occur
   once and only once. With Setter Injection there is the possibility to forget to set some of the dependencies</p>
