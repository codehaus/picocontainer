	<p>PicoContainer-Web 2.0 released</p>
	<p>This is the first release of a PicoContainer Web.  It has a 2.0 release number because it is tracking the release cycle of PicoContainer itself, and cannot rely on PicoContainer 1.x.  Formerly these web components were part of the NanoContainer project.</p>
