<title>Pico Web Remoting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Pico Web Remoting (PWR) allows web requests to be bounded
directly to methods in a class. All public methods are eligible, and
method parameters are pulled from query-string or form post-fields for
invocation. PWR is not a page technology as such, as it uses AJAX
invoation of methods on the server side. As such you most likely going
to use this technology from JavaScript, with a library like <a
    href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> that makes calling server-side
functions that return <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> replies
easy.</p>
<span class="callout">Every Object gets a URL !</span>
<p>We have tried to make PWR <strong>as transparent as
possible</strong>. Thus objects that can be published via PWR, are POJOs. It is
up to you whether you interface/impl separate them, but be reminded that
by default all public methods will be published. As with all of the
PicoContainer Web technologies, you will decide which scope a component
belongs in - application, session or request - and compose them
accordingly.</p>
<h2>Example webapp : Simple email package.</h2>
<p>We forked an example of jQuery and Java together made for an IBM
AlphaWorks article: <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-jquery1/">Working with jQuery, Part 1: Bringing desktop applications to the browser</a>. The original had a custom servlet to
decode requests, invoke methods and craft JSON replies. We've
essentially deleted that servlet and leveraged PWR instead.</p>
<h3>Binding objects to URLs - how it works</h3>
<p>In the demo webapp there a 'send' method on a class called 'Sent'.
The class name and method name are encoded in the URL. The method
parameters are pulled from the form post fields, and the reply is a JSON
representation of the methods return type. Here are some screenshots
from a Firefox plugin called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6647">HttpFox</a> and how the web request maps to
the source method.  The case in question is for the 'send' function of the Simple email app: </p>
<p><img src="images/PWR-POST.png" alt="post" name="post" width="871"
    height="1296" id="post" /></p>
<p>MessageData is just a POJO:</p>
<p><img src="images/PWR-POST-MessageData.png" alt="post" name="post" width="803"
    height="667" id="post" /></p>
<p>A GET invocation is quite similar. Instead of form post-fields
the method parameters are mapped to query string parameters.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>If PWR encounters an exception during the processing of a method
invocation, it takes the message text and makes it available to the
client in the following style:</p>
<div class="source"><pre>
{
  "ERROR": true,
  "message": "no such message ID"
}
</pre></div>
<h2>Doing the scoped Dependency Injection setup.</h2>
<p>Composition of the webapp is done in an implementation of
  WebappComposer, like so:</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>
package org.picocontainer.web.sample.jqueryemailui;

import org.picocontainer.web.WebappComposer;
import static org.picocontainer.web.StringFromRequest.addStringRequestParameters;
import static org.picocontainer.web.IntFromRequest.addIntegerRequestParameters;
import org.picocontainer.MutablePicoContainer;
import static org.picocontainer.Characteristics.USE_NAMES;

public class JQueryWebappComposer implements WebappComposer {

    public void composeApplication(MutablePicoContainer appContainer) {
        appContainer.addComponent(MessageStore.class, InMemoryMessageStore.class);
    }

    public void composeSession(MutablePicoContainer sessionContainer) {
        // stateless
    }

    public void composeRequest(MutablePicoContainer requestContainer) {

        addStringRequestParameters(requestContainer,
                &quot;to&quot;, &quot;subject&quot;, &quot;message&quot;, &quot;view&quot;,
                &quot;userName&quot;, &quot;password&quot;, &quot;userId&quot;, &quot;sec&quot;);

        addIntegerRequestParameters(requestContainer, &quot;msgId&quot;);

        requestContainer.addAdapter(new User.FromCookie());
        requestContainer.as(USE_NAMES).addComponent(Auth.class);

        requestContainer.as(USE_NAMES).addComponent(Inbox.class);
        requestContainer.as(USE_NAMES).addComponent(Sent.class);
    }

}
</pre>
</div>
<p>In the above there is a single application-scoped component, InMemoryMessageStore,
  for all users/sessions and requests to share. All
  other components are added at request scope, meaning they are only
  instantiated at the time of request and only if they are needed. The
  major components are Auth, Inbox and Sent. They have their public
  methods made available. Inbox and Sent methods are effectively not
  available until login has been performed via the Auth class. Once you
  have logged in, a cookie is set, thus User.FromCookie (a Provider)
  allows access to that. The parameters for the methods in Auth, Inbox and
  Send are made available via the addStringRequestParameters(..) and
  addIntegerRequestParameters(..) methods. These set up multiple Injectors
  for to allow the binding by name of things from query-string parameters
  or form post-fields.</p>
<p><span class="callout">Convention over Configuration !</span></p>
<p>PicoContainer Web Remoting(by default) does not have XML files like Spring, JBoss or XWork (Struts2). It also tries to be as transparent as possible - there are are no base classes to extend, no interfaces to implement, and no mandatory annotations, no bean definitions, no URL mappings, no property assignments - you just call methods on components from a web page in JavaScript. This makes it easy to test components in plain unit tests too.</p>
<p>Here is an fairly standard web.xml for a PicoWebRemoting
  webapp:</p>
<div class="source">
  <pre>
	<web-app>
	  <display-name>Pico Web Remoting Demo</display-name>

	  <context-param>
	    <param-name>webapp-composer-class</param-name>

	  </context-param>

	  <filter>
	    <filter-name>pwrFilter</filter-name>
        <filter-class>org.picocontainer.web.remoting.PicoWebRemotingServlet$ServletFilter</filter-class>
	  </filter>

	  <filter-mapping>
	    <filter-name>pwrFilter</filter-name>
	    <url-pattern>/pwr/*</url-pattern>
	  </filter-mapping>

	  <listener>
        <listener-class>org.picocontainer.web.PicoServletContainerListener</listener-class>
	  </listener>

      <servlet>
        <servlet-name>pwrServlet</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>org.picocontainer.web.remoting.PicoWebRemotingServlet</servlet-class>

      </servlet>

      <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>pwrServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/pwr/*</url-pattern>
      </servlet-mapping>

	    <welcome-file>index.html</welcome-file>
	  </welcome-file-list>

	</web-app>

<h3>Limiting Scopes to Publish</h3>
<p>In the web.xml file, you can specify a 'scopes_to_publish'
  element that takes a comma separated list of scopes. One or more of
  'application' , 'session' and 'request' (without the quotes). This
  listed will be analysed for publication as PWR invocable.</p>
<h3>Limiting Methods to Publish</h3>
<p>Only public method on components managed by PicoContainer are
  eligible. By default, all web methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are
  possible for a matching method. However there are annotations (in
  org.picocontainer.web) with  names @GET, @POST, @PUT, @DELETE, that restrict down
  possibilities. If you want a component's method to be only available for
  POST, put a @POST annotation above it. If you have a public method that you do not want to publish in a component that is otherwise published, use @NONE.</p>
<h3>Shortening URLs to objects.</h3>
<p>PWR by default will encode the whole class name including
  package. All dots in the package name are changed to slashes to make
  apparent directories, and the case of the Class name itself is
  preserved. With a web.xml element called 'package_prefix_to_strip' it is
  possible to eliminate a prefix for all of the objects published. Thus,
  you could essentially turn
  http://mycompany.com/r/com.mycompany/store/Cart/buy into
  http://mycompany.com/r/store/Cart/buy if you wanted.  The /r/ prefix is the mapping to the servlet that is configured in the 
  web.xml - it could just as easily be /pwr/ or /rpc/ or /ajax/ </p>
<h3>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection</h3>
<p>Many AJAX capable technologies are vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
PWR is no different. If you are running your webapp publically, and there
are functions that could be valuable for a hacker to invoke simulating
genuine user action, you will want to guard them. With PWR, you would
set something in the page, that would be send back to the server with
each AJAX request. The Guard class would be instantiated before the
potentially vulnerable method would be invoked. The guard class would be
instantiated and depend on the guard parameter, ensuring that it could
be verified and that an exception could be thrown:</p>
<div class="source"><pre>requestContainer.addComponent("guard", MyGuard.class);
requestContainer.as(GUARD, USE_NAMES).addComponent(VulnerableThing.class);
</pre></div>
