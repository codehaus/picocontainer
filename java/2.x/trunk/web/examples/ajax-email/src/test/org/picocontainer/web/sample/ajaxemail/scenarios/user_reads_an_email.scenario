Given user is viewing their Inbox
When the first email listed is double-clicked to read an email
Then main page should be obscured
And a blocking mail-form should be visible
And the mail-form should show the clicked email

When the 'Cancel' button is clicked
Then the Inbox should be accessible
Then main page should not be obscured
And a blocking mail-form should be gone
