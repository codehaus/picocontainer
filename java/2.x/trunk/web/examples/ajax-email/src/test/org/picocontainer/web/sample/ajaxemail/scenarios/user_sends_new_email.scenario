Given user is viewing their Inbox
When the 'Compose' button is clicked to compose an email
Then main page should be obscured
And a blocking mail-form should be visible
And that form should have nothing in it

When the mail-form is filled
And the 'Send' button is clicked
Then main page should not be obscured
And a blocking mail-form should be gone
And the mail should be visible in the sent mails list
