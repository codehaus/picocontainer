    <release version="1.0-alpha-2-SNAPSHOT" date="In CVS">
      <action dev="tirsen" type="update">
        Factored out logic for creation of aggregating proxy for a
        container's components. This opens up for alternative
        implementations using e.g. cglib.
      </action>

      <action dev="tirsen" type="update">
        Refactored the ComponentFactory interface so that IoC type 3
        (based on constructors) is no longer mandatory.
      </action>

      <action dev="tirsen" type="add">
        A Bean-style component factory is provided for components 
        implemented as Java Beans. (Empty constructors and setXxx 
        methods taking one argument).
      </action>
        
      <action dev="rinkrank" type="update">
        ImplementationHindingComponentFactory is now a decorator rather
        than a subclsss of the default one, making it usable in conjunction
        with any other ComponentFactory.
      </action>

      <action dev="rinkrank" type="update">
        Improved the getAggregateComponentProxy method so that when a
        method is called on the proxy, the returned value will also
        be a proxy that aggregates.
      </action>

      <action dev="paul" type="add">
        Added optional lifecycle interfaces and LifecyclePicoContainer 
        in picocontainer.lifecycle. This package is optional, and can be
        used as inspiration for implementation of other containers that
        handle lifecycle transparently with extra methods on the container.
      </action>
