   ! TODO generate this file from JIRA with XSL/JSL. CVS will contain 
   ! too luch garbage to possibly create this log UNLESS we decide on
   ! special commit messages. This could be done by starting the CVS
   ! commit message with ADD|FIX|UPDATE and have JIRA automatically
   ! create new issues of type New Feature|Bug|Improvement. Would be really
   ! really cool.

    <release version="1.0-alpha-2-SNAPSHOT" date="In CVS">
      <action dev="rinkrank" type="update">
        Improved the getAggregateComponentProxy method so that when a
        method is called on the proxy, the returned value will also
        be a proxy that aggregates. This currently only works for
        interfaces, but work is in progress to make it work with
        regular classes too. (This will require cglib, and will
        be provided in an optional package).
      </action>

      <action dev="paul" type="add">
        Added optional lifecycle interfaces and LifecyclePicoContainer 
        in picocontainer.lifecycle. This package is optional, and can be
        used as inspiration for implementation of other containers that
        handle lifecycle transparently with extra methods on the container.
