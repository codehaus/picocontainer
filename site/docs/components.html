<h1>What is a component ?<br>
</h1>
A component is a class that, for PicoContainer at least, is
characterized in the following ways :<br>
<br>
Doesn't have to implement or extend anything<br>
Declares one or more constructors where the arguments are the
component's dependencies.<br>
Reusable in many different deployments<br>
<h3>1. Constructors</h3>
One or more constructor that many have other components as parameters.<br>
<br>
The constructor is not mandadatory. PicoContainer will use the
constructor with the largest number of satisfiable arguments.
Currently, primitive (int, boolean ets.) types cannot be used, but
their class counterparts can.<br>
<h3>2. Reusable in many different deployments</h3>
The ability to be instantiated in a variety of deployment scenarios
(root, servlet, applet ClassLoaders etc)<br>
<br>
Probable (but not mandatory) interface/implementation separation.<br>
