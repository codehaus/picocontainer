PicoContainer (the project) ships with a few containers.
<h3>DefaultPicoContainer</h3>
The basic PicoContainer.&nbsp; No frills.&nbsp; This one has component
registration by class.<br>
<h3>CompositePicoContainer</h3>
This one takes an array of PicoContainers to build a contrived single
container. You may use that container as the parent to others. Thus
trees of containers are not the only design.<br>
<br>
Any Pico-style container that honors the PicoContainer interface can be
eligible for inclusion in the composite. These could be
DefaultPicoContainer or any other the Nano containers (sister project),
or those from third parties.<br>
