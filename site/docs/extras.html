<h3>AggregatedContainersContainer</h3>
This adapter takes a number of containers and aggregates them into one
container.&nbsp; You may use this when you are building graphs rather
than
trees of components.&nbsp; It may be used as a parent container to
another container, or directly.<br>
<br>
It is not, in itself, pico component-spec compatible (it has an array
in its constructor). A
bespoke subclass could be. <br>
