<h2>Overview</h2>
The history of PicoContaner is tied to that of IoC itself. There are
three main types of Inversion of Control.&nbsp; The names for these
have been recently evolved by Martin Fowler and friends and publicised <a
 href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">here.</a><br>
<ol>
  <li><a href="contextualized-lookup.html">Contextualized Dependency
Lookup</a></li>
  <li><a href="setter-injector.html">Setter Dependency Injector</a></li>
  <li><a href="constructor-injector.html">Constructor Dependency
Injector</a></li>
</ol>
One, two and three were
roughly evolved in that order.&nbsp; One has been diminant for
a number of years.&nbsp; PicoContainer authors have either formerly
promoted
it, or avoided it because it felt overly complicated.<br>
<br>
Two and
three came into being within a short space of each other in the last
year or so.&nbsp; Both were created as part of aquest for transparency
and simplicity.<br>
