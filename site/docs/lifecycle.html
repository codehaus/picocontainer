  <title>Lifecycle</title>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Lifecycle is at least half of Inversion of Control.&nbsp; The other
half is component dependancy resolution and configuration.&nbsp;
Lifecycle concerns the post composition (instantiation in type-3) life
of the component.&nbsp; Typically start and stop are the most commonly
encountered lifecycle methods.<br>
<h2>No Lifecycle</h2>
For really simple PicoContainer compatible components, you would not
bother with a lifecycle beyond Instantiation and Garbage Collection -
both of which are consequences of basic use of say
DefaultPicoContainer.&nbsp; This is the vast majority of Pico
components in the vast majority of applications.<br>
<br>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">public class Foo {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; public Foo() { <br>      // yipee, I am alive, active, going, steaming ahead, strutting my stuff.<br>   }<br>}</pre>
<h2>Simple lifecycle - LifecyclePicoAdapter&nbsp;<br>
</h2>
With LifecyclePicoAdapter, we have provided a very simple set of
interfaces for start(), stop() and dispose()....<br>
<br>
The LifecyclePicoAdapter honors the classic lifecycle concepts for
components.&nbsp; These are start(), stop() and dispose().&nbsp; If any
of the components implements one of the applicable interfaces, the
calling of the same method on the container ( post
instantiation of component ) will find that the call is percolated
though to
it.&nbsp; The container is forgiving, as it is just fine if some of
none of the components contained are Startable etc.<br>
<br>
Suitable components :<br>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">public class Peach implements Startable, Stoppable, Disposable {<br>   public Peach(DependantComp dComp) {<br>      // no wait, I'm fully composed but should wait for further instruction<br>   }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; public void start() { <br>   }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; public void stop() { <br>   }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; public void dispose() { <br>   }<br>}<br><br>public class Kiwi implements Stoppable {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; public void stop() { <br>   }<br>}</pre>
A component that needs adaption ...<br>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">public interface Banana {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; public void banana();<br>}<br><br>public class BananaImpl implements Banana {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; public void banana() { }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; public void start() { }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; public void stop() { }<br>}<br><br>public BananaExtender extends BananaImpl<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; implements Startable, Stoppable{<br>}</pre>
Or...<br>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">public class BananaDelegate implements Banana, Startable, Stoppable {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private Banana realBanana = new BananaImpl();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public void start() {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; realBanana.start();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public void stop() {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; realBanana.stop();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>}&nbsp;<br></pre>

<h2>Custom lifecycles</h2>
<p>Custom lifecycle management is a common requirement for components.
Probably because it is so crucial there are many competing
implementations, and
each has its own passionate group of advocates.</p>
<p>Pico tries to avoid controversy by being completely agnostic about
the
lifecycle/lifecycles that it supports. Pico does have an implementation
of a simple lifecycle (see org.picocontainer.lifecycle and
PicoLifecyleAdapter) but this is there
only as a convenience.</p>
<p>Instead of mandating a single restrictive lifecycle, Pico provides
hooks that allow you to plug in almost any concievable lifecycle (or
for that matter any other 'aggregated' behaviour).&nbsp; As it happens
the PicoLifecycleAdapter uses the getCompositeComponent() feature of
PicoContainer.<br>
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">public class Mango implements QuantumLeapable {<br>   public Mango(DependantComp dComp) {<br>      // no wait, I'm fully composed but should wait for further instruction<br>   }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; public void leap() { <br>      // Oh boy!<br>   }<br>}<br></pre>
