PicoContainer is a small, simple container for arbitrary components. It
is embeddable and extentensible. PicoContainer is designed for server
and client side, for small and enterprise applications. There are
already quite a few diverse containers that deliver the PicoContainer
design. Components can be created for it without importing or extending
any interfaces or classes outside of the java.* package. Components
also have no meta-info specification. I.e. no XML. Most importantly of
all, components for PicoContainer can be used without PicoContainer for
good old-fashioned hard-coded deployments. Some of PicoContainer's
greatest assets are its non-intruvesiness, simplicity light weight and
extendability. Not mentioning that PicoContainer fits perefectly well
with code developed along the lines of TDD and mock objects. And what's
in it for you? Code that is more modular (loosely coupled), easy to
test, easier to configure, and easier to maintain. PicoContainer is
more than an IoC container. It's a tribute to simple, but controlled
power.
