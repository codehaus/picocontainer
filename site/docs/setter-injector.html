<h2>Overview</h2>
Setter Dependency Injector is where the container or embeddor hands
dependencies to a component via a setter method after instantiation. <span

<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Example</span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h2>

</span>Joe Walnes whist working on <a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0471463620">Java
Open Source Programming</a> with other luminaries, started a Setter
Injector IoC design. This is marked up with doclet tags (though that is
not hard and fast) :<br>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">public class Shop {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; StockManager stockManager;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; String shopZipCode;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; /**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * @service name="StockManager"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; public void setStockManager(StockManager stockManager) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.stockManager = stockManager;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; /**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * @config name="shopZipCode"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; */<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; public void setStockManager(String shopZipCode) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.shopZipCode= shopZipCode;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; // TODO - Joe - how does setter injector do config ? Same way?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; public void initialize() {<br>       // all setXXXs are now done :-)<br>   }<br>}</pre>
The container use the meta-information to resolve all the
dependencies.&nbsp; Components need not be interface/impl separated.
Developer's choice.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Using Setter Injector Components
Without a Container.</span></h3>
Setter Injector components can be used directly, without any
container.&nbsp; The
component-using class&nbsp; will continue to compile, but at run time
it will be apparent that there are missing dependencies.&nbsp;
The downside of this is that a developer may miss a setXXX(..) method
invocation if they are using the component directly. That is fairly
small as a risk as it would clearly be caught in the development
cycle.&nbsp; Caught in the development cycle, but maybe obscurely so
with a
NullPointerException.<br>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">Shop shop = new Shop();<br>shop.setStockManager(myStockManager);</pre>
<h2>Container support</h2>
The <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring Framework</a>
project is the best example of a container that supports
setter injector.&nbsp; PicoContainer does too, but we really believe
that constructor injector is superior.<br>
