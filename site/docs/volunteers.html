<h2>Overview</h2>
<br>
OK, so you think you might want to volunteer for something?<br>
<br>
Well, the container landscape for Pico and Nano are fairly crowded with
developers. We have some big hitters steering our development
too.&nbsp; The .NET port is already underway. It should be shadowing
the development for the Java version.&nbsp; Clearly, there are features
of the Java version that do not have peer equivalence in the .NET
version.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also features that are just not
needed.&nbsp; <br>
<h2>Components.</h2>
What we really need are components.&nbsp; Lots of them.&nbsp; In most
case it will be adaptations of existing beans.&nbsp; We're not
interested in in having components in the PicoContainer or
NanoContainer projects.&nbsp; We are interested in the having synergies
with related projects.&nbsp; If someone wants to make a component to
the Pico design then we'll support it.<br>
<br>
One we consider really important is some subtle componentization of the
excellent Jetty server.&nbsp; As well as lacing together the components
of Jetty via Pico, it would be nice to have servlets that were Pico
components (breaking the Servlet spec slightly).&nbsp; Thus an extended
Jetty could instantiate servlets that had dependencies specified in
their constructors.<br>
