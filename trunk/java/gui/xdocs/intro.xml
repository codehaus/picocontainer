PicoGui is a small Graphical User Interface for PicoContainer.
It lets you register components, and even create hierearchical
trees of containers.

You can also "execute" a particular container. Or more precisely
manage the lifecycle (such as start, stop and dispose) via
PicoGui.

Furthermore, PicoGui lets you edit simple bean properties of the
components. These properties will be set on the associated
component instance (via reflection) immediately after instantiation.

Finally, PicoGui is a great starting point for IDE plugins for
PicoContainer. This means that XDoclet and Generama (who are
just special PicoContainers) can be configured and run from
this GUI.

PicoGui's design is also based on the Pico model. All the GUI
components (the panel with the tree, the tree and text field 
listeners etc.) are laced together by a PicoContainer.

Writing a GUI the Pico way was a very pleasant experience.
I hadn't written a GUI in a year or so. I did it TDD with
PicoContainer in the back of the head, and the GUI components
just magically emerged.
