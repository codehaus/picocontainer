      Please create a new issue in PicoContainer's JIRA: 
      http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10120
      Then attach the patch.txt file.
      If your patch consists of entirely new files too, please zip them
      up and attach them too.
      
      If your patch includes JUnit tests and a decent description,
      you increase the chance of having the patch applied by some
      of the committers.
