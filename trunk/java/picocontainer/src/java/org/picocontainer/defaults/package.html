<p>This package contains the default implementation of the {@link org.picocontainer.PicoContainer}
API. The main class in this package is {@link org.picocontainer.defaults.DefaultPicoContainer},
which satisfies both the {@link org.picocontainer.PicoContainer} and
{@link org.picocontainer.MutablePicoContainer} contracts. In addition, it allows passing in of a
{@link org.picocontainer.defaults.ComponentAdapterFactory}, which can be used to customize the type
of {@link org.picocontainer.ComponentAdapter} that is used for components that are added to the
container for which no component adapter is specified explicitly.</p>

<p>This page contains a brief low-level overview of the default picocontainer implementation
package. Much more documentation is available on the
<a href="http://www.picocontainer.org/">PicoContainer website</a>.</p> 

<h3>Buzzwords</h3>

<p>The implementation provided in this package is very extensible, embeddable and lightweight, to
get a few buzzwords out of the way.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>extensible</strong>. A popular way to extend the container is to not really extend
it at all, but rather to feed the <code>DefaultPicoContainer</code> a custom-written component
adapter factory, for example one that creates adapters that support a different kind of IoC. For
really advanced applications you may wish to subclass <code>DefaultPicoContainer</code>.</li>
<li><strong>embeddable</strong>. This implementation has no external dependencies aside from the
java class libraries, is written in 100% pure java, and requires next to no set up to use. Good
examples of how the default picocontainer package can be embedded in an application can be found
in the <a href="http://www.nanocontainer.org/">nanocontainer project</a>.</li>
<li><strong>lightweight</strong>. The base PicoContainer package supports various ways to do
<a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">dependency injection</a> (including
{@link org.picocontainer.defaults.ConstructorInjectionComponentAdapterFactory constructor
injection},
which is used by default, and
{@link org.picocontainer.defaults.SetterInjectionComponentAdapterFactory setter
injection}), nothing more. With about 3 dozen classes, the picocontainer jar file (including the
PicoContainer API) is under a 100kb in size, small enough to use in just about any project.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes on Exceptions</h3>

<p>Almost all exceptions thrown in this package are subclasses of
{@link org.picocontainer.PicoException}, which is a subclass of {@link java.lang.RuntimeException}.
Furthermore, those exceptions are usually be subclasses of the basic pico exception types specified
in the API. As an example, {@link org.picocontainer.defaults.CyclicDependencyException} is a
specialization of {@link org.picocontainer.PicoInitializationException}.</p>

<p>It is not recommended that you catch the specific exceptions thrown in this package (except
perhaps if you're developing your own container based on this package). Rather catch the broader
exception classes defined as part of the core PicoContainer API, and minimize the ties your
application has to the implementation package.</p>

<h3>Notes on ComponentAdapters and ComponentAdapterFactories</h3>

<p>Most of the {@link org.picocontainer.ComponentAdapter} implementations in this package are
subclasses of either {@link org.picocontainer.defaults.AbstractComponentAdapter} or
{@link org.picocontainer.defaults.DecoratingComponentAdapter}. Subclasses of the former can
generally be used on their own, whereas subclasses of the latter wrap another ComponentAdapter,
providing slightly different behaviour or additional functionality. For example,
{@link org.picocontainer.defaults.CachingComponentAdapter} extends
<code>DecoratingComponentAdapter</code>. It can wrap any other adapter to
provide a singleton-like behaviour (where a single component instance is kept per container).
Contrast this with {@link org.picocontainer.defaults.ConstructorInjectionComponentAdapter} (a
subclass of <code>AbstractComponentAdapter</code>), which actually creates instances (using, in
this case, constructor dependency injection).</p>

<p>All component adapters in this package include a matching <code>ComponentAdapterFactory</code>.
The classnames of those factories can always be found simply by appending "Factory" to the name of
the component adapter class. One adapter factory deserves special mention: {@link
org.picocontainer.defaults.DefaultComponentAdapterFactory} is the factory that is used by
{@link org.picocontainer.defaults.DefaultPicoContainer} if none is explicitly specified.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you follow similar patterns if you write your own component adapters.
If you are not sure what type of adapter you need, it is often a good idea to start with a
decorating component adapter, so that you can mix and match functionality from the existing
adapters with your own. Also, always try to include a <code>ComponentAdapterFactory</code> for your
custom adapter.</p>

<h3>Notes on Parameters</h3>

<p>Advanced PicoContainer users may need to have full control over what parameters are fed to
components on instantiation, and the PicoContainer API provides this control via the
{@link org.picocontainer.Parameter} class. The default implementation provides two commonly used
parameter implementations: {@link org.picocontainer.defaults.ConstantParameter} for passing
"constants" (like primitive types and strings) to components and
{@link org.picocontainer.defaults.ConstantParameter} for passing a specific argument to the
component by specifying the key that should be used in retrieving that argument from the
container.</p>
