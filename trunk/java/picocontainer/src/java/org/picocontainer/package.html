<p>This package contains the core API for PicoContainer, a compact container for working with the
<a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">dependency injection</a> pattern. When you use
PicoContainer for dependency injection, you create a new instance of {@link org.picocontainer.MutablePicoContainer}, add class definitions,
{@link org.picocontainer.ComponentAdapter} component adapters, and component instances created through other means. Then, after you
start the container, you retrieve instances through the {@link org.picocontainer.PicoContainer} interface. The container will create all
the needed instances for you automatically, resolving their dependencies. The default container implementation is
the {@link org.picocontainer.defaults.DefaultPicoContainer} class.</p>

<p>An extensive user guide,
a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) with answers, and a lot more information is available from the
<a href="http:/www.picocontainer.org/">PicoContainer</a> website. You can also find various extensions, wrappers
and utility libraries that are based on this core API there.</p>
