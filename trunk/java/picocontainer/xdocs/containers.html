<h1>Containers</h1>
PicoContainer (the project) ships with a few containers.
<h2>DefaultPicoContainer</h2>
The basic PicoContainer.&nbsp; No frills.<br>
<h2>HierarchicalPicoContainer</h2>
This one has all the features of The default container plus the ability
to have a parent container. Useful for building trees of containers. <br>
<h2>AggregatedContainersContainer</h2>
This one takes an array of PicoContainers to build a contrived single
container. You may use that container as the parent to others. Thus
trees of containers are not the only design.<br>
