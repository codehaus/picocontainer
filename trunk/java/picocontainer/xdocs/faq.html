<h1>Frequently asked questions (and answers)</h1>
<h2>What if my component depend on non-component objects (such as configuration, ints and strings)?</h2>
This is not supported in the current release (1.0-alpha). We have a design and have almost implemented support for it.
Will be included in next release.

<h2>Why can my components only have one constructor?</h2>
In order for Pico to unambigiously deduce what dependencies your component have. If you require your component to have
several constructors for other purposes, consider creating a Pico-compatible wrapper or sub-class.
