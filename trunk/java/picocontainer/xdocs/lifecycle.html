<h1>Lifecycle</h1>
<h2>[ Revamp - lifecycle stuff was taken out of Pico recently - watch
this space - Paul]<br>
</h2>
<h2>Initialization Component assembly and configuration.</h2>
This happens lazily after registration. If you call start() (below) if
will force the container to iterate thru the components and instantiate
in order, resolving dependancies and configuration concerns as it
goes.&nbsp; Some Pico containers maye choose a late strategy, others
early.<br>
<h2>StartableLifecycleManager</h2>
This interface is implementable by a Pico container.&nbsp; It indicates
that the container can handle lifecycling of components it contains.<br>
<h2>Starting</h2>
After Initialization a component may be started. In fact this happens
after all of the components have been initialized.&nbsp; It is subject
to the pluggable implementation, but it generally means that start()
will be called if it is present on a component.&nbsp; It is entirely
optional.&nbsp; It is likely to be used for the starting of threads or
opening of socket listeners.&nbsp; Start() can be repeatedly called
provided stop() has been called between start invocations.<br>
<br>
For PicoContainers that implement LifecycleContainer, if start() is
called at the container level, it is percolated all the way thru to the
components.<br>
<h2>Stopping</h2>
For PicoContainers that implement LifecycleContainer, if stop() is
called at the containerlevel, it is percolated all the way thru to the
components. In the reverse order of assembly, the components will be
stopped.&nbsp; All the pluggability comments for Starting are true for
stopping.<br>
<h2>Disposal</h2>
Again pluggable in implementation and enforced by LifecycleContainer,
dispose() can be called on the container and percolated all the way
thru to the contained components. Once called the container is
effectively dead. Of course, different pico containers may choose to
handle this differently.<br>
<br>

LifecycleContainer Interface<br>
<br>
&nbsp; public interface LifecycleContainer extends Container {<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void start() throws PicoStartException;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void stop() throws PicoStopException;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; }<br>
<br>
This adds some life cycle management to Pico Containers. The
instantiating class may call start() on the container which, subject to
implementation does some conceptual start on the components that
optionally recognize the applicable start design.&nbsp; This may of use
when a thread is needed to be started (private to the component) for
some daemonized life. It is a pluggable implementation (along Pico
Component designs) of course.&nbsp; The default being a NullObject
implementation.<br>
