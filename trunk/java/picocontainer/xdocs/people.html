<h2>People ?</h2>
(alphabetical order)<br>
<h2>Paul Hammant</h2>
Paul is 35, works for Thoughtworks UK. He used to freelance but is now
happy at TW. Paul practices XP on client site and&nbsp; loves open
source. He also works at Apache on the Avalon project and AltRMI. He
loves the simplest thing as a design metaphor, hates too much XML. He
loves the lowest common denominator (LCD) as a mechanism for
facilitating divergent designs. To that end, he encourages multiple
implementations of LCD ideas and APIs. Paul hopes to see Milli, Kilo
and Mega implementations of the Pico idea.&nbsp; He hopes to see a
myriad of interchangeable Pico Components. He hopes to see standard
APIs for components emerge from those implementations, but never be
forced when teams cannot agree. It would be fairly easy to guess that
Paul does not like big up-front design. That not withstanding the fact
that he used to do bucket-loads of it&nbsp; Paul with Aslak, wrote the
first lines. Paired, under the influence of a couple of beers, and
based on Joe's story of type 2 IoC with Rachel Davies at the start of
June 2003.<br>

<tt>Paul asked me to introduce myself to the list so you can get a
better picture of what I'm about. I'm not great at these bio pieces so
I'll use a section of Pauls email to prompt me:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&gt;could you introduce yourself to
the mail list? A few</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&gt;paragraphs on who you are what
makes you tick, how old, </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&gt;where live, passions, philosophy,</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&gt;methodologies, design ideals,
hopes for Pico etc</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

Right then. I'm 30. I'm from a small town in the middle of nowhere in
Ireland. I'll buy you a pint if you've head of it. "Clara". In Irish it
means "flat place". It is. The Irish don't have much imagination.
Except for Joyce.<br>
<br>
I've been in software for about 10 years. Highlights include tech lead
on Iona's OrbixWeb orb, research on a "next generation case tool" that
has patents pending (although company is now bust). Currently
freelancing through IBM into Nokia where I'm leading a team that
produces the user administration component of a B2B portal. I'm
personable, a good leader (by example, I like to think) and practical.
I refuse to get involved in politics and try to "fight a good fight" by
focussing on getting the job done. I'm living in Helsinki, near the sea.<br>
<br>
My primary non-software hobby is fiction writing. I post some of it,
the humorous stuff, on my personal website www.mikehogan.net. The
picture there is not really me :-) I see a large overlap between
fiction writing and software writing and the connection gets stronger
in my mind the more I do both. Fundamentally both are about encoding of
knowledge. One executes in a CPU, another in a brain. I feel our
industry we might have something to learn from the writing industry,
where there are career disciplines that we don't have, namely editor,
critic and reviewer. I can go into this in more detail when the
thoughts properly fuse in my head, maybe in a blog. Its an interesting
discussion.<br>
<br>
Anyway, back to software. I'm on the agile side of the agile-BigM
divide. I believe that the single most important thing in software is
the code, and never cease to be amazed by how complicated the world of
management have made things. As such, I personally strive to install
many of the XP practices where I work, within the limits of the
corporate culture, although I try to avoid the word "extreme".<br>
<br>
My passion is hard core OO, which is what I want to master. I have a
long way to go, but I believe this knowledge transcends all technology
fads and is therefore one of the underpinning disciplines. Of the paths
open to me, I am not totally gone on an "enterprise architecture",
management, methods, web services, bpel etc. So I want to really master
the craft of decomposing a system in to an elegant domain object, hence
my interest in component oriented programming, aspects, composition and
the kind of software metrics preached by Robert C Martin/Mike Clark.<br>
<br>
Design ideals? I have none that are unique. I try to follow the advice
of the agile movement and iterate (see, this is like fiction, except
writers call it "drafting"), unit test (I am not yet a hard core
TDDer), keep it simple, document only when necessary (and even then on
a wiki), refactor. If I was forced to chose one design over all others
it would be the Pragmatic Programmers "Don't Repeat Yourself". If
software is about encoding knowledge, then it is done most efficiently
and elegantly when there is no repetition. (The same applies in
fiction: a sentence that repeats words already in the sentence is not a
nice sentence). BTW the Pragmatic Programmer is one of my fave books,
along with Code Complete and anything Martin Fowler writes.<br>
<br>
My hopes for Pico. I hope to grab Scott McNealy by the scruff of the
neck, drag him down here and say "See this. Huh? See this PicoContainer
thing right here? Make it part of core java right now or I'll flatten
ye". I hope that Pico becomes the de facto approach for all future
software, that there is a rich world of components, that components are
locatable and easily composed. I'd like to see it facilitate
interceptors, and maybe also a community of interceptors. I'd like to
see it facilitate component composition via mixins. I'd like to see it
facilitate lookup of different impls of a given interface based on a
key (Paul reckons there is a better way). I'd like to investigate
whether Nano can provide base classes that enable common functionality
like logging. Check out &lt;a href="<a
 href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/backpedal/backpedal/src/java/"
 target="_blank">
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/backpedal/backpedal/src/java/</a>net/sourceforge/backpedal/nano/BackpedalNanoContainer.java?rev=1.1&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup"&gt;BackPedalNanoContainer&lt;/a&gt;.
Makes for neat code. I'm interested to see if there is something that
can be done with JMX and Nano (hazy here), since I think management is
one of the great neglected areas.<br>
<br>
I have other aims too. I want to write a framework that produces a UI
directly from an object graph. Similar to NakedObjects, but more an
embeddable thing than an application framework. And once thats done, I
want to complete the project I started that provides project management
with brains. Now, I said I was on the agile side of things and I am.
But many companies are not and will never be. They insist on their
microsoft project and anal tracking and projection six months into the
future. Thats how it is for me now. I have to fill out spreadsheets,
proprietary forms, databases and paper work to say I worked a 60 hour
week and task x is 80% done. I believe most of this stuff can be
replaced by a computer. So this tool makes all this crap effortless for
the developer, keeps managers from your desk and still provids them
with all the data they like to play with.<br>
