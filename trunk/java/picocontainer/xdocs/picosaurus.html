<span style="font-weight: bold;">PicoComponent</span><br>
<br>
A component designed to work in a PicoContainer.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PicoCompatible</span><br>
<br>
A component compatible with PicoContainer. Is likely to be a
PicoComponent.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Picoification</span><br>
<br>
The act of refactoring a codebase to turn existing components into Pico
compatible ones.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Picosicate</span><br>
<br>
The art of dithering with respect to a pending Picoification.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Picant</span><br>
<br>
The often false declaration that a component cannot be turned into a
pico component. Leaves an unsavoury taste in mouth.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Picograpghy</span><br>
<br>
A retrospective article by a developer on the subject of
Picoification of a set of components to the PicoComponent design.
Usually a tool that the developer is font of. Usually to a blog.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Piconate </span><br>
<br>
See Picoification.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Picoscate</span><br>
<br>
Inept Picoification. Code being messy as a result.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Picofile</span><br>
<br>
A developer who rappidly believes that PicoContainer to be the greatest
thing ever.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Picosistance</span><br>
<br>
The movement against Picoification and PicoContainer. This divided into
two camps (who hate each other). There is the StaticIsKing group (many
of whom hate each other as well as themselves).&nbsp; There are also
fellow IoC believers who hold a candle for alternate IoC designs.
Usually type-2 or type-1 of which there are many. We have not
identified any other groups in the type-3 IoC space - could be
something to do with Picovelation.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Picovelation</span><br>
<br>
The realisation that there is not more simple or elemental IoC design
for component assembly.<br>
