<h2>Overview<br>
</h2>
A component is a class that, for PicoContainer at least, is
characterized in the following ways :<br>
<ol>
  <li>Does not have to implement or extend anything.</li>
  <li>Declares one or more constructors where the arguments are the
component's dependencies and configuration.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Reusable in many different deployments.</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Transparent</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3>2. Constructors</h3>
One or more constructor that many have other components and
configuration as parameters.<br>
<br>
The constructor is not mandadatory. PicoContainer will use the
constructor with the largest number of satisfiable arguments.<br>
<h3>3. Reusable in many different deployments</h3>
The ability to be instantiated in a variety of deployment scenarios
(root, servlet, applet ClassLoaders etc)<br>
<br>
Probable (but not mandatory) interface/implementation separation.<br>
