  <title>Constructor Dependency Injector</title>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Rachel Davies, while reviewing Joe's book, left a Fermat-like margin
note when view a snippet like the above.&nbsp; "Why not use
constructors ?".&nbsp; Brilliant and simple.
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">public class Shop {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;StockManager stockManager;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;  String shopZipCode;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public Shop(StockManager stockManager, String shopZipCode) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  this.stockManager = stockManager;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  this.shopZipCode = shopZipCode;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;}</pre>
Note, for this there is no need to declare needs in any other way. No
interfaces, no doclet tags, no external XML. Just your simple
component(s)
and PicoContainer.&nbsp; No need for post assembly/config
initialization either.&nbsp; If it is constructed (not withstanding
some
asserts on nulls) it has its needs satisfied.&nbsp; Components need not
be interface/implementation separated. This is the coder's choice.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Using Constructor Injector Components
Without a Container.</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;The component can be used directly, without any
container.&nbsp; The missing dependency scenario is not an issue for
Constructor Injector<br>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">Shop shop = new Shop(myStockManager);<br></pre>
<h2>Container support</h2>
PicoContainer was the first container to support and popularize this
for of dependency injection.&nbsp; <a

has been retroffitted with constructor capability, but is natural
setter dependency injector framework.<br>
