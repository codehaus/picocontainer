<h2>Overview</h2>
<br>
PicoContainer committers introduce themselves in their own words and
are listed in alphabetical.<br>
<h3>Paul Hammant</h3>
Paul is 35, has worked for <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>
UK since 2002 and is co-lead of the PicoContainer project. He used to
freelance but is now
very happy at TW. Paul practices XP on client sites and&nbsp; loves
open
source on which he is chief zealot for TW. He formerly worked at Apache
on
the Avalon project and remains there working on <a
 href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/altrmi.html">AltRMI</a>. He
loves the simplest thing as a design metaphor, hates too much XML. He
loves the lowest common denominator (LCD) as a mechanism for
facilitating divergent designs. To that end, he encourages multiple
implementations of LCD ideas and APIs. Paul hopes to see Milli, Kilo
and Mega implementations of the Pico idea.&nbsp; He hopes to see a
myriad of interchangeable Pico Components. He hopes to see standard
APIs for components emerge from those implementations, but never be
forced when teams cannot agree. It would be fairly easy to guess that
Paul does not like big up-front design. That not withstanding the fact
that he used to do bucket-loads of it&nbsp; Paul with Aslak, wrote the
first lines. Paired, under the influence of a couple of beers, and
based on Joe's story of Rachel Davies' comments to his setter injector
IoC work at the start of
June 2003.<br>
<br>
It is also worth noting that Paul got drunk with Aslak to start
PicoContainer on
the day a world class coder was effectively expelled from Apache. He
voted against that action and won't go into details, but believes that
it was
wrong.&nbsp; PicoContainer was a way of handling the pain he
felt.&nbsp; It
deliberately embraces the LCD ideal, and multiple implementations. Paul
will eternally resist the unification of all Pico and Nano containers,
and also resist a big fat XML design for declarations of component
needs and wants in Pico and Nano containers.<br>
<br>
Paul is also well known for <a
 href="http://www.enterpriseobjectbroker.org/">Enterprise Object Broker</a>
and <a href="http://www.jesktop.net">Jesktop</a><br>
<h3>Aslak Hellesoy</h3>
Aslak is very accomplished in the Open Source space and co-lead of
PicoContainer.&nbsp; He leads <a href="http://xdoclet.codehaus.org/">XDoclet</a>,
and has taken over <a href="http://qdox.codehaus.org">QDox</a> from
Joe. He wrote most of the impressive <a
 href="http://middlegen.codehaus.org/">MiddleGen</a>, and has
refactored <a href="http://xdoclet.codehaus.org/generama/">Generama</a>
out of both.&nbsp; From an observers point of view Aslak is prolific.
Aslak was assimilated into <a
 href="file:///D:/DEV/pico-site/docs/ThoughtWorks">ThoughtWorks</a> in
2003.&nbsp; [ Words by Paul ]
<h3>Mike Hogan<br>
</h3>
Paul asked me to introduce myself to the
list so you can get a
better picture of what I'm about. I'm not great at these bio pieces so
I'll use a section of Paul's email to prompt me:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&gt;could you introduce yourself to
the mail list? A few</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&gt;paragraphs on who you are what
makes you tick, how old, </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&gt;where live, passions, philosophy,</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&gt;methodologies, design ideals,
hopes for Pico etc</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Right then. I'm 30. I'm from a small town in the middle of nowhere in
Ireland. I'll buy you a pint if you've head of it. "Clara". In Irish it
means "flat place". It is. The Irish don't have much imagination.
Except for Joyce.<br>
<br>
I've been in software for about 10 years. Highlights include tech lead
on Iona's OrbixWeb orb, research on a "next generation case tool" that
has patents pending (although company is now bust). Currently
freelancing through IBM into Nokia where I'm leading a team that
produces the user administration component of a B2B portal. I'm
personable, a good leader (by example, I like to think) and practical.
I refuse to get involved in politics and try to "fight a good fight" by
focussing on getting the job done. I'm living in Helsinki, near the sea.<br>
<br>
My primary non-software hobby is fiction writing. I post some of it,
the humorous stuff, on my personal website www.mikehogan.net. The
picture there is not really me :-) I see a large overlap between
fiction writing and software writing and the connection gets stronger
in my mind the more I do both. Fundamentally both are about encoding of
knowledge. One executes in a CPU, another in a brain. I feel our
industry we might have something to learn from the writing industry,
where there are career disciplines that we don't have, namely editor,
critic and reviewer. I can go into this in more detail when the
thoughts properly fuse in my head, maybe in a blog. Its an interesting
discussion.<br>
<br>
Anyway, back to software. I'm on the agile side of the agile-BigM
divide. I believe that the single most important thing in software is
the code, and never cease to be amazed by how complicated the world of
management have made things. As such, I personally strive to install
many of the XP practices where I work, within the limits of the
corporate culture, although I try to avoid the word "extreme".<br>
<br>
My passion is hard core OO, which is what I want to master. I have a
long way to go, but I believe this knowledge transcends all technology
fads and is therefore one of the underpinning disciplines. Of the paths
open to me, I am not totally gone on an "enterprise architecture",
management, methods, web services, bpel etc. So I want to really master
the craft of decomposing a system in to an elegant domain object, hence
my interest in component oriented programming, aspects, composition and
the kind of software metrics preached by Robert C Martin/Mike Clark.<br>
<br>
Design ideals? I have none that are unique. I try to follow the advice
of the agile movement and iterate (see, this is like fiction, except
writers call it "drafting"), unit test (I am not yet a hard core
TDDer), keep it simple, document only when necessary (and even then on
a wiki), refactor. If I was forced to chose one design over all others
it would be the Pragmatic Programmers "Don't Repeat Yourself". If
software is about encoding knowledge, then it is done most efficiently
and elegantly when there is no repetition. (The same applies in
fiction: a sentence that repeats words already in the sentence is not a
nice sentence). BTW the Pragmatic Programmer is one of my fave books,
along with Code Complete and anything Martin Fowler writes.<br>
<br>
My hopes for Pico. I hope to grab Scott McNealy by the scruff of the
neck, drag him down here and say "See this. Huh? See this PicoContainer
thing right here? Make it part of core java right now or I'll flatten
ye". I hope that Pico becomes the de facto approach for all future
software, that there is a rich world of components, that components are
locatable and easily composed. I'd like to see it facilitate
interceptors, and maybe also a community of interceptors. I'd like to
see it facilitate component composition via mixins. I'd like to see it
facilitate lookup of different impls of a given interface based on a
key (Paul reckons there is a better way). I'd like to investigate
whether Nano can provide base classes that enable common functionality
like logging. Check out <a
 href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/backpedal/backpedal/src/java/net/sourceforge/backpedal/nano/BackpedalNanoContainer.java?rev=1.1&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">BackPedalNanoContainer</a>.
Makes for neat code. I'm interested to see if there is something that
can be done with JMX and Nano (hazy here), since I think management is
one of the great neglected areas.<br>
<br>
I have other aims too. I want to write a framework that produces a UI
directly from an object graph. Similar to NakedObjects, but more an
embeddable thing than an application framework. And once thats done, I
want to complete the project I started that provides project management
with brains. Now, I said I was on the agile side of things and I am.
But many companies are not and will never be. They insist on their
microsoft project and anal tracking and projection six months into the
future. Thats how it is for me now. I have to fill out spreadsheets,
proprietary forms, databases and paper work to say I worked a 60 hour
week and task x is 80% done. I believe most of this stuff can be
replaced by a computer. So this tool makes all this crap effortless for
the developer, keeps managers from your desk and still provids them
with all the data they like to play with.<br>
<br>
We can't remember whether we've asked Mike to join <a
 href="file:///D:/DEV/pico-site/docs/ThoughtWorks">ThoughtWorks</a>. We
probably did, and Mike is happy at <a href="www.nokia.com">Nokia</a>
in Finland [ Paul ]<br>
<h3>Jon Tirsen</h3>
Jon is a passionate fellow who's invidually accomplished in the Open
Source space.&nbsp; <a href="http://nanning.codehaus.org/">Nanning</a>
is one of his babies, and he's a committer to <a
 href="http://www.prevayler.org/wiki.jsp">Prevayler</a>.&nbsp; With
Aslak, <a href="http://damagecontrol.codehaus.org">DamageControl</a>
is is latest project.&nbsp; Jon was assimilated into <a
 href="ThoughtWorks">ThoughtWorks</a> in 2003. [ Words by Paul ]
<h3>Chris Stevenson</h3>
<p>I have worked for ThoughtWorks UK since mid 2002, after moving to
the UK from
Adelaide, South Australia (where all the good wines come from).</p>
<p>I seem to be getting into the habit of working on really
pathological legacy
systems and leaving them just as they start to get interesting.
Componentization
is a key tool in fixing these beasties, hence my interest in containers.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of simplicity and what I think of as 'sensible
defaults' and
the half hour rule - if I can't get it doing something useful in half
an hour
then its probably not worth it.<br>
</p>
<p>Chris was assimilated into <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>
in 2002.</p>
<h3>James Strachan</h3>
James used to dislike IoC, when the type that forced you to implement
interfaces was the only choice.&nbsp; He championed the whole 'beans'
effort at <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache</a>, particularly in <a
 href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/">Jakarta-Commons</a>.&nbsp;
Most recently he's one of the <a href="http://www.coredevelopers.net/">CoreDevelopers</a>
and a leading figure on Apache's <a
 href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/geronimo.html">Geronimo</a>
project.&nbsp; Most exciting of all of James' activities has to be the
new <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> language (thank
god James got off his XML horse - Ed). James refuses to join <a
 href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>. [ Words by Paul ]<br>
<h3>Joe Walnes</h3>
Joe Walnes is one of those high accomplished people, with a trail of "I
must work with him" fans and quality Open Source projects behind
him.&nbsp; He wrote <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/sitemesh/">SiteMesh</a>,
and large chunks of <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com">OpenSymphony</a>.
He started <a href="http://qdox.codehaus.org">QDox</a>, and <a
 href="http://xstream.codehaus.org">XStream</a>.&nbsp; One of the
unsung heroes of Java/.Net development. Joe was assimilated into <a
 href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> in 2002. [ Words

<h3>Dan North</h3>
Dan is a passionate Agile Coach and Developer.&nbsp; He's adept at a
huge range of languages, with Ruby being his current favorite. This is
his first foray into Open Source. Dan was assimilated into <a
