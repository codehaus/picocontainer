<h1>Differentiators</h1>
Pico components (to remind you) are simple java classes that declare
their dependencies in the constructor(s). No meta XML for dependencies.
No classes/interfaces to extend/implement.<br>
<h3>Sun specified nearly-IoC Containers &amp; Component designs</h3>
It could be said that Sun have created a few container/component
designs.......<br>
<h4>Enterprise Java Beans<br>
</h4>
Clearly Entity and Session beans run inside a container.&nbsp; The API
is well defined, and to varying degrees of success one can deploy EJB
appllications to WebLogic, WebSphere, Orion and JBoss etc.&nbsp;
High use of element-normal XML for assembly and configuration. There
are some mandated
parent objects and interfaces for various to extend and/or implement.
Resolution is done by the components themselves via JNDI more often
than not.<br>
<h4>Servlets</h4>
Not so obvious - Servlets are contained by a servlet container. They
are generally bundled with (or replaced by) value added propositions
like JSP, but it is still a container/component design.&nbsp;&nbsp;
High use of XML for assembly and configuration.&nbsp; Servlets have no
concept of parent container or the conatainer above that (sometimes
EJB) and&nbsp; its provision of components, which is very unfortunate.
Servlets have a number of interfaces to honor, none of which is too
malignent. Servlets typically deal with external (or parent) components
via RMI or JNDI.&nbsp; In more recent releases of EJB, local interfaces
rather than RMI may be the mechanism for connection the parent
components.&nbsp; WebLogic have always provided a optimizing mechanism
for this interoperation.<br>
<h4>Applets</h4>
Applets, though not so often used by people presently, are a good
example of Container/Component separations.&nbsp; There is very little
XML in use by Appletss.&nbsp; Configuration is typlically delivered in
applet tags in HTML. Applets are granted some access to the parent
container, the brower, and&nbsp; its DOM model for pages and other
applets.&nbsp; There little standardisation for Browser as a container.<br>
<h3>Non IoC container-like things by various<br>
</h3>
<h4>Mainable (Sun)<br>
</h4>
"public static void main(String[] args) {}"&nbsp; Familiar?
Hopefully not :-) No component that is statically launched is a IoC
component. This includes static launching of Java Webstart (JNLP)
applications.<br>
<h4>Singleton (pattern) </h4>
The singleton pattern was detailed in the "Design Patterns" book.&nbsp;
It seems like a good idea, is typlically statically and publicly
accessed in Java.&nbsp; Overuse makes for bad solutions.&nbsp; In the
IoC world we would replace this with a container managed single
instance.<br>
<h4>Static Factory (pattern) </h4>
Used in a similar way the Singleton pattern (and similarly detailed in
"Design Patterns"), this allows disparate classes to create/get other
components.&nbsp; Very dirty applications result from overuse of static
factories<br>
<h4>JNDI</h4>
A huge map of clunkily access components via a very non-IoC mechanism.
It has to be strapped with much XML to prevent inappropriate
access.&nbsp; This is not IoC because the component reaches out for
external component dependancies whenever it feels like.&nbsp; This last
fact coulds Serlvets and EJB in use.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>AWT, Swing, SWT (gfx
toolkits)<br>
</h4>
Nice container/component designs. In the case of Swing, perhaps a
little dificult for coders to easily assemble applications.<br>
<h4>Eclipse (platform)</h4>
The Eclipse platform is very compelling.&nbsp; It supports the notion
of a pluggable application concept. Each component statically accesses
other components via a factory (which at least Paul does not like),
though it is clear that some complex classloader magic is going on.<br>
<h3>Other IoC container / component designs</h3>
<h4>Avalon-Framework and associated containers</h4>
Apache hosts a project that has been running for years called Avalon.
It has many components that fit that its design and many
containers.&nbsp;
Avalon components are characterised by implementation of many optional
interfaces. Avalon components are distributed with meta-information in
XML in the jar file.<br>
