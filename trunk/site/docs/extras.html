<h3>DefaultLifecyclePicoAdapter (Java)</h3>
See <a href="lifecycle.html">lifecycle</a><br>
<br>
This class adapts a PicoContainer instance to have start() and stop()
capabilty. If start() is called, and any of the contained components
implementes "Startable" then start() is called on that component.&nbsp;
DefaultLifecyclePicoAdapter is one implementation of
LifecyclePicoAdapter. If any other concept of start/stop is required,
then this class deomostrates how to do it.<br>
<h3>DefaultLifecyclePicoContainer (Java)</h3>
See <a href="file:///D:/DEV/pico-site/docs/lifecycle.html">lifecycle</a><br>
<br>
This true PicoContainer takes a LifecyclePicoAdapter and a
MutablePicoContainer in its constructor. It aplies one to the other and
represents itself as both to the class that instantiated it.<br>
<h3>ImplementationHidingComponentAdapterFactory &amp;
ImplementationHidingComponentAdapter (Java)</h3>
It is usual for containers hosting unknown components (think Applet) to
want to protect itself from hacking. One way element of the protect is
to hide the implementations of an interface. The
ImplementationHidingComponentAdapter does this by using reflection's
Dynamic Proxy facility.<br>
<h3>ThrowawayPicoInstantiator (Java)</h3>
If you have single component that you want to instantiate with unknown
component dependencies, and the container itself is not important, then
ThrowawayPicoInstantiator is for you:<br>
<br>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">Class someFooImplementationClass = // from somewhere<br>Foo foo = (Foo) new ThrowawayPicoInstantiator(parentContainer, clazz).getInstance();</pre>
