  <dd>
    <p> We recommend using PicoContainer when your application consists
of many different classes (components) that are related to each other.
Instantiating and lacing/connecting a lot of objects can be difficult
task. Further, if your classes know what other objects they need in
order to be a <a href="http://www.picocontainer.org/faq.html"> good

  <dt> <a name="why-another"> Why another IoC framework? </a> </dt>
  <dd>
    <p> After a long period of watching IoC frameworks, and for some of
us avoiding them because of their cumbersome nature, we got together to
write what we believe is the simplest possible IoC design. One perhaps
that considers the so-design component as more important that the
container. </p>

<dl>
  <dt> <a name="uber-pico"> Is a single
Uber|Super|BorgCollectivePicoContainer in development? Something that
can do all things for all people in all deployment situations? </a> </dt>
  <dd>
    <p> No. We are delivering small interoperable containers and
components of containers. There will never be a quest for the
BorgContainer. We encourage diversity and compatibility with the
essential idea here - components designed along the PicoContainer
principles (dependencies and config in constructors). </p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt> <a name="required-pico"> Do I have to use PicoContainer to
manage or use components designed for it? </a> </dt>
  <dd>
    <p> No. Components are instantiable and configurable without useing
PicoContainer. This was one of the design goals. </p>

<dl>
  <dt> <a name="tdd"> Is it true that PicoContainer is developed along
the principles of Test Driven Development (TDD)? </a> </dt>
  <dd>
    <p> Yes for the most part. We're not perfect though, and our
coverage reports have sometimes shown that we are making/committing
untested code. At those rare moments we switch some attention to test
coverage and whip out the electric cattle prod to reprimand the
offender (usually Paul). </p>

  <dd>
    <p> PicoContainer will instantiate a given component using the
"greediest" satisfiable constructor. By greedy, we mean the constructor
that takes the most parameters. By satisfiable, we mean constructors
where all arguments can be satisfied by other registered components. </p>
    <p> If you register a component with no satisfiable constructors,
or two or more ambiguous "largest" constructors, a RuntimeException
will be thrown when you ask for the component instance with </p>

.
    <p> We recommend, for the sake of predictablility, that
PicoContainer compatible components use only one constructor (see <a
 href="http://www.picocontainer.org/good-citizens.html"> Good Citizens </a>
), although this is by no means a requirement. </p>

  <dd>
    <p> Yes great. Configuration values/objects should also be passed
in via constructors. This is not the simplest mode of operation of the
default PicoContainer, but it is by no means hard. Just use a
ConstantParameter for Strings, Integers and Foos. </p>

  <dd>
    <p> Avalon's Serviceable, Configurable and Initializable interfaces
are eliminated. A component writer does not have to implement anything
like those. For Startable we have a replacement design in our lifecycle
package. We're not precious though and suggest that you may prefer to
use your own lifecycle interfaces which may be more than just start()
and stop(). </p>

  <dt> <a name="avalon"> How does PicoContainer compare to EJB? </a> </dt>
  <dd>
    <p> Oh blimey, it is rather different. EJB has loads of things you
must extend, implement, provide and throw. It is also not an IoC
design. It is close i n that components are managed by a container, but
the cumbersome and static nature of the JNDI lookups ensure that it is
not actually IoC. PicoContainer is not a superset of EJB though, as it
provides no remoting capability. At least the PicoContainer compatible
components hosted in this project do not. </p>
