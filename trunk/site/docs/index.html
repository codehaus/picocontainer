<h2>Slogan</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big style="font-style: italic;">I was
expecting a paradigm shift, </big><br>
<big style="font-style: italic;">and all I got was a lousy constructor!</big></div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
PicoContainer is very simple container for very simple
components.&nbsp; It honors the Constructor Dependency Injector form of
the Inversion of control pattern (IoC).&nbsp;
Components are typically going to live inside the same JVM. The idea is
that this scales from embedded containers for simple beans to
enterprise and distributed applicagtions.<br>
<h3>Simple Example</h3>
In skeletal form, here is the simplest
possible PicoContainer compatible component:<br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; public class Shop {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    public Shop(StockManager stockManager) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre>
Imagine there were a component that could satisfy that like so:<br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; public class StockManager {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; }<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></pre>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<h3>Use without a container</h3>
We love the Pico design because we see the components being used
without a
container:<br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; new Shop(new StockManager());<br></pre>
This is particularly good for unit testing. In-container testing being
one of the most avoided forms of unit testing.&nbsp; This is where
other container designs and specifications fail.<br>
<h3>Use with a container</h3>
With a PicoContainer:<br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; PicoContainer pc = SomePicoContainer();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; pc.registerComponent(StockManager.class)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; pc.registerComponent(Shop.class)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; pc.start();</pre>
It does not matter how things are laced together. It does not matter
how tightly bound one PicoContainer is to an individual purpose.&nbsp;
The important thing is actually the components and the numerous and
imaginative deployments for them.<br>
<h2>Features</h2>
PicoContainer supports the following set of compelling features:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Dependent components are laced together through constructor
parameters</li>
  <li>Dependent components can also (optionally) be passed as JavaBean
properties</li>
  <li><a href="configuration.html">Configuration</a> of components
(based of the above)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Default <a
 href="http://picocontainer.org/picocontainer/apidocs/index.html">lifecycle</a>
support built in (start, stop, dispose), can also be extended with
additional states<br>
  </li>
  <li>Very extensible design (through for example the <a
 href="http://picocontainer.org/picocontainer/apidocs/org/picocontainer/ComponentAdapter.html">ComponentAdapter</a>),
enabling virtually any form of extensions to the core<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sister projects<br>
</h2>
<h3>PicoExtras</h3>
PicoExtras extend PicoContainer with the following features, things
like:<br>
<ul>
  <li>AOP (through integration with <a
 href="http://nanning.codehaus.org">Nanning</a>)</li>
  <li>XML configuration</li>
  <li><a href="hotswapping.html">Hot-swapping</a></li>
  <li>...and much more<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>NanoContainer</h3>
NanoContainer is a container that incorporates most of the PicoExtras
extensions into one single runnable container, almost like an
application server. <br>
<h2>Ports<br>
</h2>
<h3>.NET</h3>
Pico.NET is the port of PicoContainer to .NET. It follows the Java
design closely. Currently a work in progress by Maarten Grootendorst.
<h3>Ruby</h3>
Rico is the port of PicoContainer to Ruby by Dan North. Ruby is a
dynamically typed
lanuage, so the Pico design does not map exactly.<br>
<h3>PHP</h3>
A port to PHP 5 is currently in the progress of being written by
Sebastian Bergmann.<br>
