Fellas, congrats on the best IoC container I've seen.&nbsp; I've played
with Avalon, XWork and Pico/Nano and the latter is the best I have
used. (<a

<h2>Mathias Bogaert (25th June 2003)</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">paul_hammant: While it is fresh. Could
you write a couple of paragraphs on you intial reaction and why you
warmed to Pico ?<br>
m_bogaert: sure<br>
m_bogaert: I'll put it on email<br>
paul_hammant: I'll put on the propaganda page<br>
paul_hammant: please also don't hold back on how much of a hard time
you gave Aslak <br>
m_bogaert: I do realize that I can moan about stupid naming stuff<br>
m_bogaert: but that's me, the perfectionist <br>
paul_hammant: no dude, from a couple of days ago...<br>
paul_hammant: not the rename stuff<br>
paul_hammant: when you were fonder of <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">type2</span> Setter Injector<br>
paul_hammant: the intial YIM chat story you had with aslak<br>
m_bogaert: ah ok<br>
m_bogaert: yep I still have it...rereading to see how I evolved <br>
paul_hammant: we can direct "instant objecters" to it in future to save
time <br>
m_bogaert: so aslak stated that I was bitching? hehe<br>
m_bogaert: or giving a hard time? <br>
paul_hammant: I was sitting next to him dude<br>
paul_hammant: he did not say you were bitching<br>
paul_hammant: it was clear though that he had an uphill struggle
convincing you<br>
paul_hammant: if it was some one he did not like, he might have given
up and we would have made an enemy<br>
paul_hammant: best to get the "user story" now to save time in future<br>
m_bogaert: hehe<br>
m_bogaert: ok sent<br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
</span>Here is what you asked for, my initial reaction on <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">Type 3</span> Constructor
Injector IOC:<br>
<br>
When I started out with XWork IOC (<span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">type 2</span> Setter Injector
), I really liked the
clean enabler interfaces, and the fact that you could switch
implementations and scopes by defining it in an XML file. Also the
integration with XWork, the fact that I had my own little Actions
implement eg. ConfigurationManager was so neat and clean. I was in love.<br>
<br>
Then came along <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Type 3</span>
Constructor Injector IOC. My initial reaction was 'aaarg where would
my nice enabler interfaces fit?', because ForgotPasswordAction
implements UserManagerAware looked so sexy. So I ignored it for a while
and kept on converting my components into <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">type 2</span> Setter Injector
IOC. Converting.
Converting. Damn, soooo many blahAware interfaces. Then I started
thinking again. A component should manage itself. A component should
enforce their dependencies. A component should not live without context
(other components set on it). <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">Type 2</span> setter Injector
IOC doesn't support this all, AND
makes me write 2 classes for each component (the component and the
enabler).<br>
<br>
After a chat with Aslak, I saw the light, and the next day it struck
me... <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">type 3</span>
Constructor Injector was a better solution then <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">type 2</span> setter Injector.<br>
